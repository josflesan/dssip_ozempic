          "I always tend to make it abundantly clear when I start dieting and what I’m doing. That way if someone offers me a doughnut or whatever I can turn it down without feeling bad and sometimes I just need to vent. I have a good relationship with my coworkers so that’s probably helpful. I’ve also used the ol “I wish!” I heard it can be super helpful! As someone who’s been overweight her whole life, I will NEVER put down someone for using surgery, medication or whatever to help lose weight. It’s hard no matter what and those things are still just tools to help lose weight.",

Weight loss with a partner who doesn't understand the changes the other person is trying to make, doesn't see all the effort, and when there could be better communication is so much harder. I can see how the chin thing is hurtful. I also see where communication can be improved as a couple. I'm not a dr, but I've been to couple's counseling  where they emphasize I statements and create a neutral ground to express concerns. Something like I feel ______ when __________ happens. I am trying really hard to _________ and it is discouraging when ________. Exc. \n\nWhen it came to weight loss I summed up my success to looking at my calories, and going from there. I measured everything, calculated how many calories I was eating, found my TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) using an online calculator and by putting in my stats. Yours is going to be different since you have an infant and are producing milk for that child. (I'm not exactly sure how many more calories you need because of that. I would go to a doctor that could help you figure it out.)\n\nMost importantly, be kind to yourself. Your body just went through a lot of changes and is trying to get back to normal.

But new research suggests that keeping positive secrets to yourself can have an “energizing” effect.\n>\n>The study, published in the November issue of The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition, included five experiments with a total of 2,800 participants between the ages of 18 and 78.\n>\n>In one experiment, participants were given a list of 38 types of positive personal news, like a new romance, an upcoming trip or being in a position to pay down some debt. On average, people reported they were experiencing about 15 things on that list, five to six of which they hadn’t told anyone about.\n>\n>Participants were then randomly assigned to reflect on an experience they had talked about with others or one they were currently keeping secret. Those who reflected on secret good news reported they felt much more “energized” than those who reflected on good news they had already shared.\n>\n>“It’s not energy in the sense of, you know, ‘I just drank coffee,’” said Michael Slepian, an associate professor of business at Columbia University, the author of “The Secret Life of Secrets” and a lead researcher on the study. Instead, he described it as a kind of “psychological energy,” more like the feeling you get when you are deeply engaged in something.\n>\n>The research nuances our understanding of the science of secrets, which so far has focused on the detrimental effects, said Andreas Wismeijer, a lecturer in psychol",

This includes ignoring texts if she texts you about it—if it’s a group chat you can ignore and text with other people in the chat if you want\n- Leave. This includes physically leaving, hanging up if you’re on the phone, and/or giving yourself a break from any texts\n\nIf she does not stop, you need to start leaving.

If not, it’s an option to go no-contact.\n\nRemind yourself that any lashing out is not about you, it is a temper tantrum because you are setting boundaries. Having boundaries is a completely reasonable and healthy thing, but some people in your life will be upset by that. Even if it’s coming from “good” intentions, it’s them getting upset that they can’t push you. That’s their problem, not yours.\n\nAs someone who has had to do this with relatives for various boundaries… it is tough. It hurts if/when they lash out.

Those who would tell me I was overweight and offered advice in a more I guess…caring?… way. They continued to do so till I was perceived as the average weight or ideal look is when they finally stopped. Well they didn’t stop. They just went from “here’s how to lose it” to “I’m concerned you’ve lost too much.”\n\nAnd the other people in my close relationship life usually only had positive or concerning things to say but mostly passable because drastic weight loss in front of those close to you is definitely concerning especially if they don’t know you’re doing it. Since non-intentional weight loss is often a sign of something medical going on (if that were the case.)\n\nHowever, the more heavy or other overweight people in my close life usually have more mixed results in their perception of me. It’s usually always concern or they don’t sound like they care much. When I tell people how much weight I lost, they want to know “the secret.”\n\nI tell them it was through calorie counting and willpower and usually that ends the enthusiasm of my weight loss and their curiosity. I find that in my experience of telling people they want to know my “definitely easy way secret to weight loss” so that they can “definitely easily” lose weight too and when I tell them it was just the regular recommended way of doing it, you just have to have the motivation and willpower to start and get through it they instantly give up asking me for any advice and seem to become more bitter. And this is FAMILY.\n\nAnd it sucks too, because the hardest part of losing weight was gathering information and developing a strategy and processing it all.

I want to reach my peak physical health and not get winded and drenched in sweat from going up the stairs. But I just wish people would stop commenting on my body until I reach my goal :/",
          "Keeping it a secret. So, I’m toying with keeping my weight loss a secret.  I’m kind of deriving a secret pleasure from it.  Do you think it’s unhealthy to do so?  Is it deceitful?\n\nMy life is filled with very weight-conscious people, and they all have different opinions.  My husband does not like when I go on diets or try to lose weight.  He makes me feel guilty about it.  I have a whole bunch of coworkers on Ozempic, and they have all lost a ton of weight and talk about it constantly.  They lose it so fast, I just don’t want to compare what I’m doing with what they are doing.  My parents are the people who caused my issues with food in the first place, and they always mess up my head when I talk about weight with them.\n\nI’ve gone from 207 to 189 and nobody has really noticed yet, aside from just saying I look happy or complimenting my outfits (which never used to happen).\n\nI know at some point people will notice, but I really want to just brush them off.  Like if I get asked, “have you lost weight?” Just being like, “oh…. I don’t know…” and then changing the subject.\n\nI don’t know, maybe it’s wrong to do this?  I just don’t want pressure or attention around it.  I’m just doing this for myself and my own happiness.\n\nPlease give me your thoughts on this.  Has anyone else just chosen not to talk about it with anyone?",
          "So i am also very awkward about weight or appearance questions, so my default go-to is cluelessness. I've gone from 206 to 184 but it's taken like two freaking years, so it doesn't feel like anything to me. \n\nSo when my mom and sisters were here for thanksgiving and were like, \"Did you lose weight? You look thinner!\" I was like, \"uh, i don't know, really?\" And when they said at least I *looked* thinner, I was like, \"oh, okay, uh thanks\" and they dropped it cause there was basically nothing to talk about.",
          "I tell people i don’t feel comfortable with my body being topic of conversation. I appreciate the compliments but I don’t want to make it an ongoing conversation.",
          "\"heheh...y-you too...\"",
          "The first time I lost weight (have since gained some back- working on it) I avoided bringing it up until it was impossible not to notice, and even then only willingly talked about it when others brought it up first. Don’t regret a thing, and have continued to follow this pattern for fitness/diet talk in general. I think it’s healthy. \n\nWeight is just one of those topics where everyone has an unsolicited opinion to share… and it’s almost never helpful. We have limited time and energy. Ideally we want to spend that on actions that directly benefit our health instead of wasting energy smiling and nodding along to thinly veiled pleas for emotional reassurance disguised as advice.",
          "Oh I just meant I don’t think she needs Ozempic at 115, nothing about being too skinny. Her weight is my goal! I’m also very careful as to never comment on her appearance at all.",
          "Honestly, you might need a break from your mother. I have had no contact now with my mother for four years and it has frankly been exactly what I’ve needed to get me to where I am right now which is a pretty good place.  You may want to check out codependents anonymous.",
          "I would probably just say things like, i’m happier at this weight, or, this is how i always was and you’re used to seeing me bigger which wasnt normal for me. Or even just say it looks more drastic because the exercise has toned you up. And after that just jokingly say, we already had this conversation a few times and change the subject. Then after that you can start to say, this again? I knowwwww. And close it down more that way",
          "Self hate",
          "I always wonder whether it’s how some people acknowledge it. I think I’ve found that friends and family are reluctant to bring this up until there is a really significant change, almost like they’re worried about jinxing it or something! I also reckon some people think it’s like the positive way to engage is to try to help you further along the the journey but as others have alluded to, maybe holding your ground and clarifying that you’re not looking for their advice is the best way to set those boundaries",
          "If you feel comfortable keeping it a private subject,  then do that. At some point people are going to pry about it and you can tell them what you want. Your hubby, on the other hand, you may need to tell him more because he is obviously going to notice sooner than later.",
          "\"Nobody asked you\"",
          "Not sure If by “smart” you mean sarcastic.\n\nIf so, you can say something like “I’ve been trying to eat more but *somebody* keeps eating all the XUZ out of the vending machine”\n\nWhere XYZ is a snack you’ve seen that coworker eating recently\n\nOr “I agree, been trying to put some weight back on, can you tell me what all you eat so I can increase my weight?”\n\nThese are of course asshole comments to make, but it’ll shut them up.",
          "I've lost about 25 lbs this year, I never mention it to anyone. \n\nBeing overweight I was sick of the constant weight comments like my weight was everyone else's business, now it feels like a small revenge to do something just for me and not tell anyone about it.",
          "What do you tell family . I just saw the fam for the holiday and everyone could not stop talking about how good I look. My mom especially was flabbergasted by the amount of weight I had lost. For reference I’ve gone from 187 to 155 lbs since the middle of August by being in a calorie deficit. She keeps asking me how I did it and what’s my secret but for some reason I’m embarrassed to say that I just sort of stopped eating whatever I wanted and started weighing all my food? Like idk why it’s embarrassing to admit that I realized I was overweight and didn’t/dont want to be anymore. I was getting flustered talking about it. Does that make sense? I know there’s no issue in telling the truth but it’s just not a conversation I’m interested in having. What do you guys tell people in situations like this?\n\nEDIT: omg I have laughed, cried, hardcore nodded in agreement 10000x over now. Seriously thank you all so much for your words of encouragement and advice. I wish I could respond to each one. This community has been so helpful during my journey and best of luck to everyone else (especially if your family is like mine haha). I feel so much better now!!! THANK YOU AGAIN",

          "Not wrong at all. I didn't tell anyone except my spouse what was going on. People caught on, and when they did I would tell them. But I found the most success when I kept it to myself for the most part.",
          "You definitely don't need to share. But just know that some people will be concerned since weight loss is a sign of cancer/disease so hiding it might not be onpletely feasible long term.",
          "Go with your gut feeling on this.  You don’t have to tell them your goals, and they aren’t secrets, they are private and you deserve privacy.  That’s one of the reasons we are here, to anonymously support each other.",
          "Lol, a young girl trying to maintain her teen body into adulthood and having to overly watch what she eats is not that complicated. She should go to the fitness subredit to get advice from other women who maintain teenage bodies into adulthood. Not a subreddit full of excuses.",

          "Either she’s used to seeing her baby be a certain way, ie it’s just a weird dumb but endearing love, or she’s the jealous type (subconsciously doesn’t want u to be looking better than her)",
          "Everyone's already given great advice, I just want to add my 2 cents about feeling flustered or embarrassed about discussing your weight loss, because I feel similarly.\n\nThis isn't the best analogy, but I think of it a little like talking about physical intimacy. I might feel comfortable talking about that kind of thing with a close friend, but not with a family member, for example. It has nothing to do with shame, it's just that it's private for me. \n\nI think it's the same with WL. Just because you don't want to discuss it with some people (or all) regardless of how complimentary they are, doesn't mean that you're not being truthful or that you aren't also proud of your progress. It can just be a topic that's private, and that's perfectly ok.\n\nAnyways, I'm off topic here but just wanted to throw that out there. Congratulations on your weight loss!",

          "How would you respond?. I was always skinny but gained weight after my son.  Within the last year and a half, I lost 50lbs just from diet and exercise (169-125 I’m 5’4”) I’m happy with how I feel and much happier with how I look.  However, every day and usually 2 or 3 times a day at work, several women that I work with make rude comments to me.  “You look like you’re wasting away.” “You’re too skinny.” “Don’t lose anymore weight.”  “That scrub top looks like a dress on you (dirty look)”\nYet, there’s other people at work that tell me I look great, that exercise with me, share ideas, etc.\nPlease, does anyone know of anything that I can say back to the rude people? I’m tired of telling them that I exercise, they act like they don’t believe me (like I’m taking ozempic) and I just am at the point that I need something smart to say back so they shut up. Any ideas? Thank you\n\nEdit: The word I was looking for but couldn’t think of is witty.  Without a doubt, I have plenty of witty responses now if I choose to give one! I’m so happy I posted this, thank you for all the great answers.  I feel more confident now in interacting with them and I appreciate you all so much!",
          "A lot of people do care. And a lot of people have been conditioned not to talk about weight because for every person who wants it recognized there is another saying they wish it would be ignored.\n\nBut I get the sense you have very specific \"people\" or a person in mind with this. And for that, I am sorry they don't treat you with more respect. If you keep at it they will, and this experience will have taught you to never trust them because their kindness is conditional.",
          "I agree! I’m actually mostly deaf too so I was thinking of just pretending that I didn’t hear them.  \nIt’s at the point where I vented about this to a coworker I’ve been close to for 10 years and then minutes later someone walked in and commented on my “too skinny” body, right in front of her.  She stuck right up for me, I appreciate people like that so much.",

Secondly, I've learned that anyone who criticizes someone who wants to be healthier or get to a reasonable weight for your height (and I say this as someone who is exactly your height with a current weight of 135 lbs and a goal of 125), they are projecting their own insecurities onto you. If you scroll through this or any other weight loss sub, you will see it's a tale as old as time; friends and colleagues not being supportive of one losing weight. Also, skinny shaming is a thing too. Saying someone who is 5'3 looks anorexic at 128 is not only a rude thing to say, but it's inaccurate and ignorant. I would reconsider friendships with people like that. \n\nOnce again, congrats on your progress.

She seemed pretty cool, but the second time I saw her to go over more things, I mentioned my want to lose weight (I had been slowly but also going so up and down but being very stagnant) because I was having trouble knowing what to eat because I would feel effects from not eating enough and wondering if not eating enough is impacting me getting better at training and running, but then not losing if I ate more. \nI didn’t get to mention it to her bc after she started talking I just didn’t want to engage anymore, but I struggle recovering from an ED as well.

Everything I learned said that’s what a toddler eats. She goes on to say it looks like I’ve lost some between visits so that’s good. She says I can get a BMR test done, after I told her one of my stressors was money- “but it’s a good investment into yourself. Online calculators are way too wrong.” She also says (and she is thin thin) when she feels like she gains weight she eats LESS THAN 1200. I was shocked. Then she gives me a couple links for cheaper ozempic. I just ended up nodding and agreeing. Who am I to argue with a dr?? \n\nBut it’s kept me thinking and making me research on my own because I’m struggling so much with thoughts and I feel like food and how much I’m having is ALWAYS on my mind.

Best recommendation would be to not ignore the hunger. Trying to build back up was harder than losing the weight honestly. Protein and shakes were the best to start with.",

          "Weight loss misconceptions. I've noticed a lot of discussions here about weight loss, and while most people mean well, I wanted to take a moment to clear up some common misconceptions:\n\n1. **Calorie Deficit Is Key:** The only effective and consistent way to lose fat is by creating a calorie deficit—meaning you consume fewer calories than you burn. To put it simply, **1 kg of fat equals approximately 7,700 kcal** (or **1 pound equals 3,500 kcal**). For example, if you eat around **2,000 kcal per day** but burn **2,500 kcal**, you're in a **500 kcal daily deficit**. This translates to roughly **0.5 kg (1 pound) of fat loss per week**. Aim for a gradual, steady loss like this. Losing more than that too quickly often isn't sustainable long-term and can affect your intake of essential nutrients. Remember, if you see the scale drop by **2, 3, or even 5 kg in a week**, most of that is likely **water weight**, not fat.\n2. **Exercise Helps, But Diet Matters More:** Cardio and exercise have incredible health benefits, but they **can't outwork a poor diet**. For context, an **hour of walking** burns about **300-500 kcal** depending on your weight and pace. That’s the same amount of calories as **one doughnut**. So, while exercise is important for overall health, strength, and metabolism, it’s your **diet** that plays the biggest role in weight loss.\n3. **No Magic Pills or Quick Fixes:** There are no miracle drugs for weight loss. Medications like **Ozempic** might suppress your appetite, but you still need to **manage your diet**. If you're using Ozempic but still eating fast food regularly, you won’t see meaningful progress. Relying on medication isn't a long-term solution. Building healthy habits around food and activity is what will lead to sustainable results.\n4. **Weight Fluctuations Are Normal:** Don’t get discouraged by **daily changes on the scale**. Your weight can fluctuate due to factors like **water retention, sodium intake, hormonal changes,** or even the timing of your last meal. This is completely normal and doesn’t mean your progress has stalled. Focus on the **overall trend** over weeks and months rather than day-to-day numbers. Progress photos, how your clothes fit, and how you feel are often better indicators than the scale alone.\n5. **Consistency Beats Perfection:** You don’t need to be perfect to see results—you just need to be **consistent**. One bad meal won’t ruin your progress, just like one healthy meal won’t magically make you lose weight. It’s what you do **most of the time** that matters. Focus on building sustainable habits: **balanced meals, regular activity,** and getting enough **sleep**. Be patient with yourself and understand that real, lasting change takes time.\n\n  \nBest of luck on your journeys.",
          "You should seriously report your doctor and get a new one. 1000 is a dangerous recommendation to get from a doctor of all things. It's a pretty serious problem for them to suggest that to someone.",
          "Hi! How long have you been restricting calories for, what are your stats (age/sex/sw/CW) and what is your goal?",
          "Calculating a rough sedentary TDEE at 190 puts me at 1800 calories a day. At my current weight, 1360. So if I had to guess... that. \n\nAnd sure, somewhere in the ballpark (although these drugs do have effects other than appetite suppression that may be part of why they work to treat obesity)... except if I were able to \"just eat that amount of calories\" I wouldn't need anti-obesity medicine, lol.",
          "According to the [TDEE calculator I use](https://tdeecalculator.net/), 1800 would be a deficit when considering the amount of exercise you're getting.",
          "Even if you eat 1300 calories a day, a cheat meal that’s 3k calories at the end of the week will erase the deficit you ate earlier",
          "I think you need to educate yourself a little on how losing weight actually works.             \n\nEvery day, your body needs a certain amount of energy to maintain its weight. We express this in terms of calories and call the amount needed to maintain your weight your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure). If you eat less than your TDEE, your body uses its stored energy (fat) to make up the difference. If you eat more than your TDEE, your body saves the extra as fat. Increasing your exercise increases your TDEE. The smaller your body is, the smaller your TDEE is.            \n\nBut most of the number you se on the scale is not fat. Most of it is water. The precise amount of water you have in your body any given day can fluctuate a lot. Diet changes are well known to impact that amount of water, as is exercise. High carb, high sodium, alcohol, etc (all the things we love to eat when not \"eating clean\") are well known to cause water retention. Hormones and stress can also be a factor.              \n\n0.5kg of fat is about 3500 calories. So to gain 0.5kg of fat, you have to eat 3500 calories MORE than your TDEE (over some length of time). That is somewhat easy to do over a week or 2, but pretty hard to do in one day. So when you see the scale jump up 1kg in 1 day, it is a pretty safe assumption that is water weight, and not fat.            \n\nAnd this is why it is more important to look at long term trends than obsessing over every day. It's also why people like calorie counting because it is a very scientific way to guarantee weight loss.",
          "How did you determine that TDEE? That… seems super low for your height and weight. Even sedentary. Your BMR is that, not your TDEE. Your sedentary TDEE is probably closer to the 2100.",
          "TDEE?",
          "My maintenance calories are 1550 and I eat 1350 a day. You don’t have to be at 1200 to see results. Up your activity and calories, and be patient. What I have found is that if I cut my calories too low I’ll just end up binging later and the progress will be pointless. Better to just take it slow. You have time, there’s no rush. It helps to focus on exercise related goals instead of the scale sometimes.",
          "How long have you been eating 1300 consistently?            \n\nSome people also find it helpful to eat in a style tailored for insulin resistance when they have troubles losing weight.",

I drank too much last night and stayed up too late, and basically needed to eat a “big” breakfast and lunch to get me through the work day.

I would give it some time and keep an eye on your results rather than the calculators for me when I was eating 1500 a day I was starving and a little miserable so I know to eat a little bit more even if that meant fitting in another day of exercise in order to balance everything. One thing I found was really helpful was focusing on gaining strength through my strength training and building my muscles I thought there was another measure of my progress Beyond just my weight.",
          "That's probably accurate. There are several formulas for estimating TDEE, and if you don't provide a body fat percentage, then they assume average body fat. Muscle burns significantly more calories than fat, so calculating TDEE at 240 lbs with an average body fat will be much larger than a TDEE calculated at 240 lbs with your actual bodyfat.\n\nHow tall are you? Waist hip neck is pretty much the most accurate measure you can get with just a tape measure. Anything more accurate you would be looking at calipers or bod pod or DEXA scan. Being female at 240, you are likely closer to 53% than 28%.",

When I was on a diet plan they suggested 1550 or 1800 calories for men depending on how quickly you wanted to lose weight and/or your activity level, with an emphasis on staying reasonably close to those figures. Going for 1550 alone let me lose like 100 pounds in a year, working out put some weight on but I'll take an extra 5-15 pounds of muscle over that same amount in fat. Just track that stuff with a calorie tracking app and you'll be fine.",

          "Uh, that is straight up false. You’re multiplying those numbers by x10 minimum \n\nEven logically this wouldn’t make sense if you think about it for a second. Gaining 20 pounds of muscle won’t make you burn up to 2000 calories a day more",

And it's pretty easy to fit some of those high calorie foods into a 3000 calorie day.   \n\nAs a short woman (I'm one too), I think we need to calibrate our expectations a little bit. There's so much less wiggle room for short women between 'so little food that you'll be miserable and possibly undernourished' and 'oops, too much, now you're gonna gain weight again'.

I even jog on the treadmill on my weightlifting days for a good 30 mins beforehand). \n\nOut of curiosity, how do you list yourself on the calculator as far as activity level? Because, while 3 times a week is better than nothing, it's only considered mildly active. I would seriously consider adding in another day or two of exercise. And not having such a large range when it comes to your calorie allowance. I would stay more around the 1600 mark and add more activity. Lots of protein. And being consistent is seriously underestimated. If I'm perfect all week and then get lax on the weekends, or even worse, binge, it will undo that entire week.

Exercise accomplishes much less than I thought, while taking up a lot of time and mental energy that I didn't have.\n\nSecond most important thing I did: focus on eating foods that I love.  I had bought into the misconception that to lose weight, I'd need to eat only \"health foods\" that I hated, like quinoa bowls and brown rice.  I absolutely did not need to do that.  I eat kebab, gyros, cheeseburgers, French Fries, chicken tenders, pepperoni pizza, quesadillas, meatball subs, tacos, sausages, cheese, Chinese, chocolate, candy, ice cream bars, frozen meals, the list goes on and on.  I'm eating lower-calorie versions of these foods and smaller portions than I ate before, but I \\*love\\* the food I eat.  That's why I feel so confident about continuing on to my goal weight.\n\nI should get to my goal weight sometime in 2025.  That will make it three years total.  I lost 94 pounds by the end of Year 1.  I'm on track to have lost another 46 pounds by the end of Year 2.  And then another 20 pounds in Year 3.  Weight loss slows way down as you go along, which is fine.  I'm happy and I don't feel deprived, so it's no problem.  \n\nI wholeheartedly believe",

          "I don't desire to be cruel here, but \"You're miscounting\" is a lot more plausible and common than \"You have an extremely rare metabolic disorder that makes you incapable of losing weight.\" That second category does exist (sorta), but it's not really worth discussing. Your post reads like every other post about how \"My calories are exactly correct, I swear, but I can't lose weight!\" If they were, you would. They aren't, therefore you aren't. \n\nThis either means they are incorrect because your metabolism is lower than you think it is, or they're incorrect because you're miscounting them in some way. The second form is extremely common. Britain made an entire reality tv series about it called Secret Eaters. People come in here with humble testimonials about how they too thought they were a genetic anomaly but then finally got real with themselves, redoubled their efforts to truly track things, and realized they were counting something *extremely* wrong. Off the top of my head, I can remember just in the past few weeks: 1. someone who thought peanut butter was mostly protein and also was serving themselves three times as much of it as they thought they were; 2. someone who wasn't counting granola in their diet \"because granola is healthy and I'm only having a small ball\"; 3. someone who was eyeballing measurements of things like oil; 4. someone who was eating a lot of trail mix and calculated it based on some averaged number they got from a Google AI prompt, and it turns out they were eating ~800 calories of it a day instead of ~200; and so on, and so on. These were all people who swore they were definitely, truly, unmistakably counting things properly, and, well, they weren't. They were finally truthful with themselves.\n\nI don't rule out the possibility that any given person really might just have the worst genetic luck of all time.

You need plenty of cardio.\n\nBut you probably nailed the issue, you have lost a lot of weight and your sednetary TDEE has reduced along with the calories you burn with activity, so you need to reaccess your caloric intake.\n\nAnd regarding lifting, I went from 255 to 160 and at 160 in order to eat normally and not regain the weight, I need to be moderately active, and most of that is from exercise, since my desk job burns nothing, and is how I got into this mess.\n\nTo be moderately active I do one hour of cardio every morning, 30 minutes of high inclined walking followed by 20 minutes brisk walking outside, 400 calories worth. That and just being more active in general gets me 600 calories. My TDEE is 2400 and I just eat, stopped counting food calories at 175 lbs. My sedentary TDEE at 255 was 2300.\n\nHere is the problem with relying on lifting. If I was lifting 5 or 6 days a week, a couple hours each day, I might then get up to that 600 calories, but that is a lot of lifting. I lift a couple days a week still, lifted every day during my diet, to preserve muscle. But only my lower days burn significant calories. And you have to have rest periods.\n\nAnyways, if I was trying to get jacked, I would lift probably 4 days a week, cardio (walking) the other days, and if I needed it, some cardio the lift days if my lifting wasn't burning enough.

That means you want to lose 11 lbs per month, or 2.8 lbs per week. 1 lbs of fat loss = 3500 kcal deficit. That would put you in a ~1400 kcal daily deficit. Since you're very short, sedentary, female and not super overweight I'd assume your TDEE to be around 1800ish kcal at most. To lose that amount of weight per week would put you in a 400 kcal daily intake, which is extremely unhealthy, not sustainable, or in other words, impossible.\n\n>For context I am 22f, 156cm and about 65kg. As of right now I limit myself to around a 1200calorie deficit. \n\nJust to clarify, if you eat 1200 kcal a day that does not mean \"a 1200 kcal deficit\".

The length of time you stuck to it def matters, because if it was to short, it may not have reflected on the scale fast enough. Gotta keep in mind while losing the scale is NOT synonymous with fat.

Mix ins, addivitves, creamers, sweeteners all have calories.   \n\n3) Some vitamins/supplements. More recently, i've found out I'm getting an extra 200 calories a day from my fish oil capsule according to their box, so some calories CAN sneak in through here.   \n\nReally though, I still need more information on what your older attempts looked like to help you figure out whats sneaking past your routine.

This person isn't in danger of starving any time soon. \n\nThis person needs a diet and therapy no matter what. A more moderate deficit isn't going to fix whatever it is that caused them to get to this state. Without work on their mental health issues it doesn't matter if they eat 500 calories a day or 2500. They're going to relapse and fall back into eating as a coping mechanism without some deep inner work. 400 lbs isn't achieved through moderate overeating. It's achieved through unaddressed mental health issues and severely disordered eating.\n\nI just really have to call BS when I see this silliness about the calories children eat.

If that were real; people who are under long term caloric deficits like WLS patients would be just stalling.",
          "So let's do the math. Starting today, you have 92 days until New Years 2025. Based on your height and weight, your sedentary BMR would be at 1625 per day. You say you are currently at 1200 calorie (I presume this is your caloric intake not deficit, because if it is the deficit that'd mean you are eating 400 calories per day). So your daily deficit is 425 calories. over the course of 92 days that you have left until 2025, you will have 39100 kcal deficit.\n\nLosing a kilogram of fat would require 7700kcal of deficit. So, At the current rate, you will roughly lose 5kg of fat if you are sedentary until the new years. Now, of course maybe your metabolic rate is higher and you may get better results. But this is the math based on your provided information.\n\nIf you want to add workouts, we can do the math for that as well. Along with your deficit from eating less, you can increase the deficit by exercise. How much? (7700kcal \\* 15) - 39100kcal = 76400kcal. So If you want to lose 15 kilograms by New Years, you need to burn 76400kcal over the course of 92 days, which rounds up to burning 831 kcal per day. Unfortunately, this equates to nearly 150 minutes of moderate cardio. If you are walking, this is about 230 minutes of walking. And It is generally a bad idea to create or make up this much deficit with exercise because it will make you hungry. So 15 minutes won't be enough to lose 15kg. In fact, 150 minutes may not be enough for that.\n\nAll this is not to discourage you, but to make sure you understand your situation and get an expectation based on math. What you can expect at the current rate is to likely lose 6-7kg until new years given your deficits. If you give it till end of January, you could lose over 8kg, maybe even 10kg. What's unlikely is that you will lose 15kg of fat by new years or end of January. If you do see 15kg off the scale, it will involve muscle loss. And for a female of your size, losing 5kg + of muscle can be detrimental to health.\n\nMy suggestion is ke",
          "If you've lost 36 lbs eating 1800 calories - you're in a deficit.  Are you currently in a plateau, or are you still losing? \n\nNow, as you get smaller, your TDEE will get lower as there will be less of you to maintain.   So you are correct, you'll need to adjust your calories at some point.  \n\nThe bodyfat reading from your scale is probably not accurate - those are easily skewed by hydration status, so while it can be useful for seeing an overall trend, I wouldn't put too much stock in the actual number.  \n\n2200 sounds like a reasonable TDEE for a person with your stats;  1700 calories per day should result in about a one pound loss per week.  If you are losing faster or slower than that rate, you can adjust the number upward or downward as needed.",

Waist 43.8 inches\nHip 50.8 inches\nNeck 14.6 inches\n\nAnd apparently that’s about 53% body fat!!\n\nAdding this body fat percentage to a TDEE calculator makes my current maintenance calories drop to 2000 calories!!

My ribs and hips are very visible and not buried my fat. Another calculator told me I’m at 28-ish%, but that’s the only one that’s been this low (also the only calculator that measured my wrist and forearm?).\n\nDoes any of this sound weird to you? I have talked to my doctor about losing weight, but he just wanted me to go on ozempic and was very unhelpful… \nAnd before anyone tells me to count calories correctly, believe me I am weighing everything I eat, I don’t drink any sugary drinks and I log EVERYTHING that enters my mouth, so that’s not an issue.\n\nEdit: I’m 5ft9in tall and shoe size 9.5, so I’m pretty big in every way.",

Yes, that is what a toddler eats, but a toddler is also gaining weight and growing at a crazy pace. If you want to gain weight at a crazy pace, eat like a toddler. 1200 is low, yes. It does make it a lot harder to get proper nutrients for an adult sized body. You have to watch out for issues when you are eating very little food, which is why it's not recommended to go lower than that unless you are being supervised or are incredibly short.           \n\nReading between the lines, your doctor probably goes on short fast diets to lose a couple pounds, so I doubt she eats less than 1200 for months at a time. The longer you do it, the more dangerous it is. She may also be a thinner, short, sedentary woman, so again, less dangerous.          \n\nTo say  “well actually most adults only need 1200 calories a day.” is wild, so I wouldn't follow her word as gospel, though.",
          "1500 is pretty typical. Its a 500cal deficit. Which is pretty standard",
          "If the ingredients for these meals are also sold in store, use the nutritional info on the back of the packages. Most tracking apps have an add function so that you add a food and it's values and then you can later add it to your daily food dairy like anything else they already had on there. You can also find some of these by googling them and then looking for results that come from other tracking apps (e.g. the fat secret app publishes online).\n\nFor things like soup, you'll unfortunately have to start preparing the meals yourself, weighing every ingredient before adding it, and then weighing out the portion you serve yourself and then using that to calculate the calories. Eventually, you get the gist of how many calories are in a cup of something or in half a packet of something. \n\nChatgpt can help if you have the calories/macros but aren't sure how to multiply or divide to get accurate numbers per portion, or if you are trying to develop a meal plan (like give it a list of ingredients you have and get it to give you low cal or high protein meals you could make from them). I try to avoid using chatgpt and other generative ai tools for things i can do myself, not only do they \"make things up\", but becoming reliant on them lead to no losing skills because we no longer practice them daily.\n\nYou can also do initial calculations for starches and swallows so that all you need to do is portion them out using the same cup/bowl every day, so its one less thing to weigh and worry about. I do this with my branflakes, i have a bowl that holds exactly 40 grams, so i just use that instead of the scale. It helps with the mental frustration of having to weigh everything.  \n\nTechnology, including chatgpt and food tracking apps, are all very biased towards the West. Most of the data is collected in the west, and things like bmi are based on the weights, lifestyles, and proportions of people in the West. It can be frustrating and demotivating to try to use them to help achieve your g",

I also increased my non-exercise activity by walking as much as I can.\n\n I may go back to calorie counting now as I'm 10lbs away from my goal and my weight loss has slowed down.  The trick is to take it one day at a time and not let one bad day derail the next one.  \n\n As for home food, I have plenty but I watch my portions.

          "Hi lifestyle med physician here 👋\nCalorie tracking is highly misleading. The amount of calories show on a food label or nutrition label is the amount of energy it takes for that food item to burn up completely in a controlled lab environment. How the food is actually processed is very different inside our bodies. Fiber slows down digestion and actually helps body to get rid of more calories from food so we don't end up absorbing it. Also how the food is processed changes the calorie amount. For example a Raw carrot has say 25 calories but if that carrot is cooked then the calorie amount increases to more than 30 calories.\n\nTry starting with eating whole plant-based Foods and focus more on nutrient intake instead of calories.\n\nI teach my clients ways to lose weight naturally and they end up having less cravings, feel more satisfied and full after eating, and have long-term success with weight loss.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have questions or want some more tips",

          "Those of you who don’t track calories but still lost the weight, how did you do it?. I don’t want to hear that “you NEED to track your calories!” I am aware that a calorie deficit is the only way to lose weight, I’ve been tracking and I’m 25 pounds down currently. I need to lose another 20-30 but honestly I just can’t track anymore. It’s driving me insane, making me completely miserable and leading to binges because I feel so guilty over every single calorie. I’m just done. \n\nSo, let’s hear from those of you who have done this without the tracking. What are some of your strategies? What didn’t work? How’d you do it?",
          "I spent a very long time recovering from binge eating disorder. Tracking was required by my bariatric program. If I didn't track at least 25 days per month, I'd be kicked from the program. It took me 15 months to get through the program.\n\n I had no idea that it was restriction leading to my binges until I started tracking. Learning that pattern helped me a lot. \n\nBUT, I still hate tracking, and I stopped tracking as soon as it was no longer required. I eat similarly day by day, so sometimes I'll track a day just to see where I'm at generally.\n\nI know this will likely have to change once I'm in the weight zone where every calorie counts, but for now, I'm enjoying eating intuitively.",
          "Every time I convince myself i don’t need to count calories, I end up gaining. However, I have a history of binge eating disorder so my hunger cues are messed up and I had to teach myself what healthy portions are.

Eating something tasty, even if it was a smaller lunch than I was used to, was way more effective for me then eating 2 pounds of salad. \n\nThe calorie counting will keep you from bsing yourself, and help you understand what tasty foods you can get away with and what tasty foods really aren't worth it. It will also reveal how much casual snacking piles on the calories. Forget completely about non-tasty foods.\n\nIf you don't count and just try to wing it then in my opinion it just makes dieting way harder. It's also harder to not count and then make up really restrictive rules like no eating bread or something.

Lost 40lbs without counting calories. Make sure that the things that fill you up and make the biggest part of your food are different vegetables. Veggies are your best friend, for reals. That and healthful proteins: eggs, poultry, fish, seafood, different dairy products like cottage cheese, skyr, etc.\n\nBut honestly, counting calories to learn this stuff yourself may be easier and feel less rigid. These are your calories and you can choose how you use them up. I don't think that you need to count for your entire life if you learn how to eat and live healthily.

          "So I think it's helpful to track for a while to understand what foods have what calorie amounts. This is especially true with sauces and salad dressings, which can be very calorically dense and TBH not that filling. For example, 200 cals = 1 chicken breast, two tablespoons of butter, or 1.5 lbs of green beans. And... uh for the sake of conversation, a 1 lb prime grade rib eye has 1200 cals. \n\nFrom there, realistically, you should pre-plan your meals and snacks. If you mindlessly eat outside of planned meal/snack times, that's going to wreck your diet.\n\nThese days, most meals I make are naturally going to fall into the 500-600 calorie range. I know they will be higher if I'm using lots of fats or carb dense foods (like pasta), or even lower if I'm using lean meats/fish and no extra fats at all. So like pasta with cream sauce is going to make me think twice. Do I know how many calories are in it without weighing it out? No, I don't. I *do* know it's going to be calorie-heavy. \n\nIf I eat like my normal stuff 4 times a day, I'm not in any danger of blowing my calorie budget.",

Half the pizza is a more appropriate amount to eat for dinner, and doesn’t make me feel like shit as a plus side. I apply this to most meals and snacks I eat and I lost 25lbs in a year by basically only doing this and walking my dog. I didn’t cut out any food I like and I don’t have a calorie log.

It makes people feel like the real effort they're putting in to change their bodies is them returning to a natural thing they should have always been doing.  Like, sure, the amount of food you're now eating is natural and normal for your body, but the work you are doing to make sure that that's the amount of food that you eat every day is a method that you're using, and you're doing a great job at it!\n\nThis is a really easy question to answer.  \"Oh I've been calorie counting.  I weigh and track my food and try to stay in a deficit.  It's been working well for me!\"",

I can eat more later if I still feel I need to. \n\n\\- What gets measured, gets managed. Kitchen scale and a human scale both are useful tools.\n\n\\- Finding new recipes and getting used to new foods can be one way to adjust what you eat, and find filling, low-calorie foods. \n\n\\- Fiber and protein every day (unless if you're fasting). \n\n\\- Thirst can be mistaken for hunger\n\n\\- Nutritional deficiencies - not just macros but also micros - can make you hungry.

It's hard because my friends were competing to weigh the least (yeah, very healthy I know /s. I was a gymnast at the time) and I was just heavier by design. \n\nHowever, I need to track my weight so I know how much to eat and stuff. So I have a tracking buddy. My partner does that for me so I don't have to look at it.\n\nMaybe, you can ask a person you trust to give you portion guidelines? Let's say you use bowls or small dishes. Your portion buddy could teach you what a small, medium or large portion of X looks like? I think it's only necessary for carbs and proteins because veggies are just great as is. You'd have guidelines w/o having to think of calories. \n\nOr maybe, for me measurements are not triggering, so maybe for you, the weight of the ingredients wouldn't be triggering?",

And she did leave room for treats so she could get a bit of extra variety.\n\nI also know another person who was very close to healthy eating, and lost weight by cutting out all sugary drinks, sticking to water and plain tea and coffee, and adding a daily walk to her routine. Kept eating the same foods in similar amounts otherwise.\n\nIf you need more portion control than that, maybe you could try something like healthy plate. A typical meal is half a plate of veggies, a quarter plate of grains or startchy veggies, and a quarter plate of protein, roughly speaking. Or in a meal like a stew with everything mixed together, add ingredients to the stew in similar proportions. Make most snacks or desserts fruit, with the occasional treat. \n\nThese are guidlines though. Not something to rigidly adhere to 100% all the time. I sometimes plan meals like this, but might add two servings of grains rather than one because I'm craving starchy foods that night.

Your amount will likely be higher than that. \n\nThen, get a tracker to help you record what you’re eating daily and aim for the amount the calculator gave you. I use MyFitnessPal, but I know a lot of people dislike that one. To work out calories in food, look at the packaging and then use a food scale to weigh your portions so you know you’re recording the correct amount. \nIt can feel a bit overwhelming at first.

I’m autistic so that wasn’t a struggle for me, but I know some people hate doing that.

It becomes second nature after a while, once you get used to what calories certain foods contain. \n\nIf sticking to your calorie goal is tough you can try zig zag counting - where you look at your cal goal as a weekly thing. So for me, some days I would eat closer to 1200, cos then the next day I can have 1600 and eat more of what I like. \n\nVolume eating (think there’s a subreddit for recipes and stuff) can help keep you feeling full and sated on fewer calories. \n\nJust eating as you are now, but tracking cals can help get you used to the discipline of doing that without the stress of hitting your calorie goal. Once you’re used to it, you can start lowering cals until you’re at your goal amount for a deficit. \n\nWalking the dog is great! Keep up with that, it’s a great way to build cardio fitness.

Eat a lot of soup, salad or veggies as an appetizer to every meal. these food will guarantee that you’re full after eating, and once you’re really full you will not want to touch another bite of food whatever it is. \n\nI know you mentioned you eat high protein but I’d start tracking it and try to aim for atleast 100-130 g a day.

Some people are finally able to lose weight on the right medication. \n\nPersonally, I have celiac disease and ravenous hunger is one of my main symptoms. If I’m eating 100% gluten free a lot of my food noise goes away. If you think you have celiac disease don’t stop eating wheat without talking to a doctor first.

I think my ultra low fat, low salt diet that was recommended in the 90’s and early 2000’s wasn’t actually any good for me. Salt and fat are very satiating. I know you can definitely overdo salt and fat but totally cutting them out isn’t good either. Adequate protein can also be an issue for some people. Some people cut out added sugars and that helps a lot. \n\nI’m just looking into testing for ADHD, but the other two things have really helped me. I still have a problem with late night snacking but I usually go all day with just breakfast, lunch, and dinner and can think about other things in between.

No amount of food will help silence the ravenous beast. Eating more will NEVER help silent those thoughts, because they are invasive and a mental problem, not a physical one. You acknowledge you’re not hungry. You acknowledge you don’t need more food. You are not a victim. You are the one in control. Just like a parent shouldn’t give candy to their toddler every time they scream and tantrum for it, because THEY ARE THE PARENT, you must do the same for your invasive thoughts. YOU control your actions. YOU put that food in your mouth. YOU are the only one who can learn to control your binges and your calories.

I have read a lot about the compulsive overeating and the massive urges that drive food addiction and it feels like what I'm battling is far beyond willpower and personal discipline. If I were to seriously lack this in my character, I would not be where I am in terms of career, education, even regular workouts and adherence to other things in life. However, I cannot get rid of the constant raging voice that tells me to eat just for the sake of eating. It yells to EAT THIS; EAT THIS; EAT THIS NEXT; WHAT ARE WE EATING NEXT, completely regardless of what is going on. I could be literally finishing a huge meal, the voice will yell to eat some next thing, even though I actively do not want to eat any more food, I know for a fact I am not hungry and I do not need any more. \n\nThis has unfortunately caused me to stupidly overeat because there just is NO (!) satiety, it does not ever kick in, I cannot stress this enough. Is is actual horror that after several meals, 5000 cal days, outrageous binges my brain is like \"hm ok, where is the next food? What is next to eat, EAT EAT EAT???\" I cannot comprehend how I am not satisfied even with amounts of food that make no sense.\n\nNow of course I researched this and the first result is that you're eating wrong. Ok. I added tons of protein and filling volume of vegetables, as well as fiber to my diet. I eat fats first in sequential eating, I cut out processed and hyper palatable foods because empty calories are known to not cause satiety. I eat mindful, drink lots of water, I take the 20 minute breaks to question the hunger/urge, I pause between bites. \n\nStill no change, I overeat by 2000 cal on foods that by themselves would be deemed healthy because my body never responds. I am not satisfied after 600g chicken breast and 1.5 kilo of cauliflower and broccoli, generous with olive oil, tomato sauce and basil. My body doesn't give a shit, all of that feels like one bite and it yells that I need more, it actually feels like I could eat another 4-6 portions of that after finishing. No form of satiety, ever. Eventually, I will get physically sick and nauseous from the sheer mass of food and STILL had the urge to eat more, I would literally burp from heartburn and have acid reflux between bites and I couldn't stop myself from eating. HOW THE HELL is my body still yelling for food at such points, most people would have been entirely unable to take another bite. I have sat there in absolute disbelief when I had raving hunger after a 5000 cal day of non stop eating. If someone walked in and offered $1000 if I just stop eating, I would miss out on that money. The drive is abnormal and scares me.\n\nThis is why I suspect an underlying issue, that is so drastic. I do not want to make excuses, blame other things than myself or look for a simple solution. I seriously want professional help to investigate wtf is going on with me and to build a long term lifestyle that is sustainable and compatible with healthy decisions.\n\nHowever, I am not in the US, I have trash insurance, I have even failed at getting adequate treatment for depression. I reached out to 2 doctors in my small city and a psychiatrist in the next large city, was put on ridiculous >8 month waiting lists only to get garbage like mirtazapine which made things worse and when I moved, they straight up admitted that they failed to transfer my records and I lost my prescription for 3 months. Meanwhile, my mother needed an inhaler and other things for her lung problems and the insurance provider argued against it and she had to pay some wildly expensive things out of pocket, as if someone would fake being barely able to breathe. With things being like that, where do I even start with this obscure mental problem that I suspect I have?\n\nI see no realistic and reliable way for me to get the clinical help that I need yesterday and it scares me to read of people who needed prescriptions for new, expensive and highly specialized medication like Ozempic, Mounjaro and whatnot. I don't have diabetes, I am not morbidly obese, I have a lot of trouble even explaining the massive loss of control that I feel outside of written communication. I have genuinely no idea how to possibly go into treatment, let alone get ahold of any of these medications. \n\nWhat can I do to actually get a grip on the food noise? This is so terrible, it is not exaggerated that this is ruining my life. It is my biggest problem, it controls my days and relationships, it damages my health and there is nothing else that occupies my thoughts like this. It consumes me so much.",

Of course it’s best and great when people can listen to their bodies, but clearly that doesn’t work for many people. Most people who are overweight desperately wish they were not. Many people struggle with a brain and body hyper focusing on food, with constant messages to eat!",

          "Yes. This. I’m not hungry. I just love to eat. But it’s like a Constant internal struggle to shut my brain up about wanting to eat. It’s distressing. I was literally up at 3am last night thinking about everything I wanted to eat for breakfast and then trying to figure out how to eat those things and stay within my daily calorie goal. And it’s like I just want my brain to shut up. \n\nI ended up eating a 400 calorie breakfast and now I’m distressed about how the remaining 1000 calories in my daily allowance will cover lunch and dinner. I’ll make it happen…I usually stay inside  my calorie allowance (which is around 1400-1500 per day)…but the internal struggle to get there is maddening. I probably just need to see a psych. \n\n(Thanks for the article link. I will read it. Really interested in the psychology behind food noise)",

Start the diet tomorrow\"...I actually respond out loud \"do I need this? Am i that hungry? Do I really need a 12 piece bucket??\" \n\nSure, some people look at me funny at times, but that chat with that demon in my head brings some sense and reasoning back in my brain before the binge. So, now i do this everytime nonsense junk craving strikes. \"Am i really hungry?? Do I really need to eat this entire pan of leftover pizza?? Would you still feel hungry after a glass of water\"...it works for me, man. It's like a voice of reason which zings me as I'm about to binge. \n\nJust did this half n hour ago as I was about to polish off a tray of Christmas lasagna from the fridge....happy to report the lasagna is still in there, and I'm here content with a glass of coke zero. :)",

          "I’m learning a bit about compulsive thoughts and thought patterns. One of the things I am working on is self image. It’s really hard for me to be happy with my body, and I regularly have thoughts that I hate my body, am not desirable, am ugly, have lose skin, whatever the brain zaps choose that day. I’m trying to stop those thoughts and not let them settle in my brain. If you’ve lived with suicidal thoughts especially impulsive ones, this might be a similar way of navigating them. \n\nSometimes our brains just throw things at us, and when we really think about it, we can see it’s not true. It’s much easier for me to see it’s not true when it’s a suicidal thought, but that just opened the door to thinking maybe not ALL of my self deprecating thoughts are true and factual. Maybe some of them are just those brain zaps that got lost and don’t really have a source or reason. \n\nNow when I get these thoughts, I try to say to myself “stop” I literally say “I am stopping this thought” in my head, and then replace it with something I like (right now that is the ocean). So instead of going into a constant spiral of negative thoughts, I am trying to break that pattern and make it not as frequent, or at the very least limit the impact when it comes. I think of the ocean and the peaceful waves, and how the sand feels. \n\nI am not sure if it is doing anything tbh but I do know it feels nice to think of the ocean. Maybe when I can break this pattern, I can live in the peaceful ocean for a bit and then build healthier patterns when I am ready. I don’t think I will ever get to loving myself but I would be satisfied with not constantly thinking about it.",

People have been reporting that Ozempic and Wegovy have not only curbed their constant appetites but it also quiets all the constant and oppressive thoughts about food. They all it “Food noise.” It describes the unending intrusive thoughts about when and what and how much a person gets to eat next mealtime. It also is described as constant thoughts about food in general.\n\nThese medications stop those intrusive thoughts. Patients are reporting it is like living a whole new life, that they feel free and can finally concentrate on other things.\n\nI don’t have weight issues beyond the extra 20-30 pounds at times.

And they are just stumbling upon it now because new drugs are giving hidden benefits. I’m LIVID, and I’m so, so sad about it.\n\nI’ve had anxiety and intrusive thoughts at times in my life and medication was the only way to deal with it. I can’t imagine living my whole life with intrusive food noise and trying to go about my day. Kudos to all of you who have and still do. It isn’t your fault. We’re getting close to a cure.",

          "How to overcome or reduce food noise?. I've struggled with food noise since I was a little kid, i'm now 30. It's not just the constant thoughts of what/when should I eat, but it's constant cravings for sweets and junk food even If I'm not physically hungry. \n\nI've done a lot of work over the years to work on myself and my health. I walk 45 min a day and go to the gym 2-3 times a week, I also stretch several times a day (sedentary job). I make a meal plan each week to cut down on wondering what I should eat. I try to focus on veggies/meats/whole grains and limit junk food. I don't drink soda. I made sure the meal plan is also easy enough to stick to on days I don't feel like cooking. But still, the food noise persists. Every day. And it's not due to not eating enough or not eating nutritiously.  Some days it's pretty quiet, some days it's constant. I mean every minute, all day. \n\nI heard that going on Ozempic helps to cut down food noise. However, I went to the doctor today and was refused because \"my weight isn't that high and I can figure it out with diet and exercise\"(i'm 190lbs and 5'6 so technically I am obese). Diabetes runs in my family, if I don't get my eating under control I will be next theres no question. \n\nI'm just sick and tired of being tormented like this. I've put in a lot of work towards body positivity, it's not an issue with how I feel about my weight, I just want to have a healthy relationship with food, I'm not looking for a crash diet or a quick fix here. I'm just tired of this constant battle. \n\nI tried to do some research and a few sources recommend cutting out fast food/junk food altogether as that will help the constant cravings and food noise go away if I'm not giving in to them. The problem is, the more I deny myself of these things, the more I want them. On the other hand, I quit smoking Marijuana after struggling with the addiction since I was 14, and quitting 100% really was the key for me in that regard. Trying to do moderation kept me going back. But it seems different with food, is it actually realistic to say I'm not going to eat junk food/fast food ever again? \n\nAnyone who has successfully reduced their food noise naturally please please tell me what you did.

          "For me, protein is like ozempic. It removes food noise",
          "Food noise can come from hunger or from cravings.  It's critical to differentiate between the two, since hunger can be, to a large extent, resolved, while cravings are typically a sign of addiction and are typically something an addict has to deal with their whole life.\n\nThe first thing you want to do is to make sure it's not hunger.  The most effective tool for combating hunger is lean protein.  Take your target weight in pounds, multiply it by 1.3 and consume that many grams of protein a day.  The next weapon in your hunger fighting arsenal is fiber.  Ramp up the veggies.  Maybe lean into psyllium husk a bit (combine it with water and let it hydrate at least an hour)\n\nIf you consume enough lean protein, you should be able confirm the noise is coming from hunger within your current caloric deficit, although ti probably wouldn't hurt to move to maintenance just to be extra certain that you're getting enough food.\n\nIf you do all this and end up hyperfocused on food  around the clock, I'm sorry, but you're probably an addict.  An alcoholic, regardless of whether or not they're in recovery, never stops focusing on alcohol.  Food addiction is the same thing. Recovery isn't about removing the craving, it's about fighting the craving. And that fight is perpetual.\n\nThe one thing you can do, which a lot of folks can't get their heads around, is abstinence.  You're not hyperfocused on chicken breasts.  Fats combined with carbs are the substance we abuse.  That's our drug.  If you're aware of this and abstain from high fat high carb foods, you can prevent yourself from binging, and avoid the torture of obesity related diseases.",

I’m persuaded by her claims that we’d do well to listen to what our bodies are telling us, but I also believe we can’t always reliably discern between what we think we want in the moment vs. what may be best for us long term (which is true of many things in life, not just food!)",

I read stuff like \"chew gum\" or \"go for a walk\", which I will use as example of low-level problem solving, and I think man, I wouldn't even call that food noise, I wouldn't even be on here commenting. When I mean food noise, I mean FOOD NOISE. Actual noise, chatter in your brain, actively carried out, non stop, perceived as something LOUD. Tormenting. Chewing your nails down because you can't escape the all-out war that goes down in every cell of your body. People who can't relate to that probably experience appetite, craving, maybe even urges. That is not food noise or at least it is not where I would set the definition. \n\nChewing gum against my hunger is like coming in with a squirt gun against a 40 acre forest fire. These methods are a speck of dust against the tectonic plates that I perceive my mental struggle would have to move. \n\n> I think my ultra low fat, low salt diet that was recommended in the 90’s and early 2000’s wasn’t actually any good for me. Salt and fat are very satiating. I know you can definitely overdo salt and fat but totally cutting them out isn’t good either.\n\nAgain, thank you for the very correct point. I used to be scared of too much salt, went for \"light\" and \"skim\" options. It made no sense. What you can sum both of this up with is: Just don't eat ultra processed food. It's that simple. \n\nYou won't (easily/reasonably) have too much salt if you salt yourself, likely using salt with idodine, sea salt and more rogher salt to begin with to taste etc humans have had that for centuries. It's when the industry refines salt, uses salts that no one has in the common kitchen, uses nitrate and salt at production steps that makes it highly inflammatory, highly reactive etc THAT is when you're introducing salt that will retain water and increase blood pressure. \n\nYou won't (easily/reasonably) have too much fat if you look at",

          "I can’t read the article due to a paywall, but my personal opinion is that weight loss medicine is more akin to getting help breaking an addiction, rather than dissociating from your body. If you’re obese, more than likely it’s not because you’re eating too many carrot sticks. Junk food and fast food are engineered to be highly palatable without providing satiety, and they are full of sugar, which works on our brain chemistry to make us feel good. Nothing about that food and its effect on our brain chemistry is natural. Weight loss drugs are a tool that helps quiet the physical cravings so people have breathing room to build good habits and address the mental health causes driving their overeating. \n\nWith regard to the article’s comment about “sleep noise” vs “food noise”—your body will force you to stop sleeping once you have had enough, and if you are sleeping way too much, that is a medical issue that people should seek treatment for. When it comes to food, people are eating themselves to death on food that provides no nutritional value. If you are eating to the point that it’s harming your health, that is a medical issue, and people should be able to seek treatment to get better.",

These things will be a fantastic start. I also started by skipping the subway ride and instead walking several kilometers a day. Walking is severely underestimated.\n\nBe mindful of what you eat. Try finding things you love, but also have a little treat every once in a while.\n\nAnd one more thing: begin step by step. Your body is already struggling, so don't go all overboard right away. Start with one thing. For example, give yourself a whole week or two to get fully accustomed to a new and healthier diet. Then you can implement the workout/exercise aspect. Again, take it easy. No need to go full on draining your body by exercising like mad everyday. Begin with 2 or 3 times a week and see how you feel.\n\nI wish you all the best and hope you'll be in a much better and happier place very soon 💗",

The \"secret\" is to eat less.  Just eat less.  There are lots of systems and methods for how to eat less, but that's the root of all of them.  You can eat the exact same food you eat now, just cut your serving size down by 1/3 and you'll lose weight.\n\nFor me personally it was helpful to start with something obvious - added sugar.  I ate a lot of it, and it was easy to track how much I was eating because it's only in processed foods and it's labeled.  For a week I just tracked how much added sugar I was eating / drinking, then I set a goal to eat 50% less of it and tracked that for a month.  I started losing immediately and I found after a while that I was less hangry and headachy between meals.\n\nAfter added sugar, I started tackling late night snacking, then making my portions at meals smaller and more inline with serving suggestions, and eventually started doing calorie and macro counting with an app.  I eat the same foods that everyone else in my house eats, but in different proportions and portion size. Nothing is \"off limits\" but I've slowly shifted some foods to be \"occasional\" and brought in some \"nutrient dense\" replacements.

Every single person I have ever seen in this subreddit has either claimed to have the same problem as you and never followed up, or admitted sheepishly that they were in fact wrong and weren't counting things properly. I have never seen a single instance of someone who actually has a metabolic disorder that would make them unable to lose weight in the scenario you claim to be in intake-wise.\n\nYou need to get a metabolic study done.

Seek out in-network specialty centers (assuming you're American, that is; if you're in a place where the healthcare system isn't a dystopian nightmare, then perhaps it is simpler to just go right over to such places), and consult with them. Hopefully they take you more seriously.\n\nNobody here will know what's wrong with you. What you're describing is, if true, an unknown medical condition that is somehow drastically reducing your BMR by a rate twice the maximum known variance that I've ever heard of. Your BMR should be approximately 1600 calories, which means that even if you were comatose, you would still be losing about 4 pounds a week on a 1200 diet (and a sedentary TDEE is about 1900). Medical literature stands for the proposition that there is approximately a 10-15% variance per person on either end of that number, up to around a 30% total variance, so one woman of your height and weight could have a sedentary TDEE as low as 1600, and another as high as 2200.\n\nIf you are correct that your intake is never greater than 1500 and is in fact some average between 1200 and 1500 (let's say 1350), then your sedentary TDEE would have to be around 1400 or so, which means you're several standard deviations b",

The name escapes me right now\n\nHer and many other people who are on it say you literally cannot over eat otherwise you feel extremely sick.\nIt also helps with weight loss overall\n\nMy mom is also in her 40s and felt as if she’s tried everything. She’s on heart medication that also made her gain a bunch of weight.\n\nI mention this because typically if you break an addiction for a long period of time it helps you with cravings and such. \n\nI also wanted to mention that I feel your struggle. I have PCOS so only specific things help me in weight loss. I could only stick to a diet for a certain amount of time just like you… I felt like giving up because I wasn’t losing/losing it fast enough. For years I would start and stop diets and have the mindset of “I’ll start tomorrow so it’s ok to eat like crazy right now” and because of all the “starting/stopping” I actually put on more weight overall.",
          "I treated my hypothyroidism with medication (this is about 10 years ago) and thereafter quickly dropped the water weight and, after a dietitian-supervised reduction in calories, several pounds of fat.\n\nI treated my anemia with iron supplements and regular consumption of rare red meat.",

I tried ozempic in the past but I didn’t drop a pound (with diet) now on metmorfin and a low carb diet an finally saw a one pound drop last week.\n\nApart from the light weight training did you do any exercise and how you determine the 1200 calories I read for pcos we need to lower the calories more than a person without issues.\n\nPD: no loose skin, one of my biggest fears, glad that you can enjoy the results of your hard work at the fullest",
          "Hi!! I saw a comment about perimenopause. I have PCOS and have dealt with never ending hormonal issues that impacted my weight. I would recommend checking out the Hormone Cure by Sara Gottfried and WomanCode by Alisa Vitti. Both these books had an enormous, positive impact on my health.",
          "I’m losing weight naturally, but I used to have a hard time because of my PCOS. Things got easier when I started focusing on improving my PCOS. I stopped drinking and eating sugary snacks and try to avoid foods with a lot of sugar and refined carbs. I also started intermittent fasting, going for walks, counting calories and weighing myself every morning, and it has helped a lot.",

          "Count calories. Everything that goes in your mouth. As a mum and home cook I know how often a little scrap gets eaten - tasting, kids leftovers. And weigh things. Cups etc are not accurate. \n\nUse a calorie tracker. Get walking in every day and if you can get running. The saying about running is bollocks. I run three times a week and it makes a big difference. Some people respond really well to cardio so results vary. Intense cardio like hitt makes you feel great. Feel good and you turn less to food for comfort. \n\nNo idea about your adrenal gland issues but it would seem a good candidate for weight gain problems so make sure your doctor is on side with what medication you need to get lean and fit. \n\nGood luck. Life is sucky sometimes but there is always joy waiting round the corner.",

It’s pretty honest about what it can and can’t do, which I appreciated.

I had that feeling of constant hunger almost my entire life... in my case, it turned out to be celiac disease which was preventing my body from absorbing most of the nutrition. Once I stopped eating gluten and was properly nourished, all of a sudden I experienced the sensation known as \"being full\" and \"not wanting to eat anymore.\" Truly life changing!",
          "Eating broccoli doesn't fill you up. It is too low calorie. You need to eat protein AND fiber to feel full. \n\nAlso those voices have to just be lived wirh sometimes. Hunger is not an emergency. It's okay to feel hunger.",
          "Assuming this is something you face, if you are in the week before your period this could be why. I don’t know if it’s universal but I’m always desperately hungry before my period. I could eat 3k+/day if I’m not stopping myself.",
          "You should never feel hungry while losing weight. Usually that means you are getting too much or having things that are high in calories and low in satiety. Have you discussed your weight loss plan with a doctor and dietician? I don't know how tall you are or how much you weigh so knowing if your calorie goal is or isn't realistic.",
          "I am going to have to look into that because the \"never feeling full\" and \"always hungry\" thing describes me EXACTLY and it is soooo frustrating because there are absolutely 0 tips or diet change that had any effect on this",
          "If youve never ever felt satieted can be a medical issue. Go talk to your doc.",
          ">when I go into a calorie deficit I get debilitating brain fog, anxiety, and sadness\n\nI’m about the same age as you, and I was experiencing this as well. Upping my protein intake (a gram of protein for every pound of goal weight) and adding electrolytes (1-2 cups of coconut water per day) was a game changer for me. I feel so much better.",
          "I don’t have the problem of not feeling full, but it very definitely is a thing - it’s not just you.  I found that out when I married my husband.  His brother has never had his brain tell him he’s full, and my mother-in-law told me that as an infant, he would cry for a bottle and if she didn’t stop him, he would drink breastmilk and formula until he puked.",
          "the way I do it is I eat less and it hurts to be hungry. You get used to it though",
          "I don't get hungry that often. A small meal can keep me full for a while. But I still eat, even when not hungry, because eating is the only thing that makes me feel anything or gives me something to look forward to. This is what makes weight loss the hardest for me. Tiktok etc. are full of people saying like just do volume eating, eat a big plate of veg, but I don't want veg I want shite.",
          "This sort of sounds like non-diabetic reactive hypoglycemia. Actually, it sounded like diabetes or pre-diabetes, but I see you've had those parameters checked and they are fine. Non-diabetic hypoglycemia isn't very common, but it does happen occasionally. The approach would be a low glycemic diet - you do mention eating high protein, but also including a well rounded amount of fat, avoiding highly processed carbs, and not eating carbs *without* protein and/or fat to slow them down.\n\nI also wonder, have you talked to your medical team about Ozempic/Wegovy? It tends to quiet food thoughts as well as suppressing actual hunger by slowing down digestion, which seems like it could be on the right track for what you're experiencing. Especially since it seems that you can eat a pretty large amount of food and yet still be starving in 2 hours, I wonder if your stomach emptying is abnormally fast. Not everything shows up on blood work.\n\nFinally, if it doesn't seem to be very dependent on how *much* you eat, have you tried simply making your meals smaller so you can have several snacks in the day? There are some people who just do best with eating 6+ times a day, never going more than 2-3 hours without food.",
          "- are you on any medications like SSRI’s or birth control? \n- have you been tested for celiac disease? Unerring hunger even when I’ve eaten enough that I may throw up was a symptom I had- I didn’t lose weight with it I actually ended up gaining. It’s a simple blood test & if the blood test is positive, endoscopy. Lots of adult ppl who have celiac disease are actually normal weight to overweight. \n- do you have food trauma? Might be a good idea to see a psychologist.",
          "Not everyone's hunger is the same. I believe doctors when they tell me that there are people with weird brains who can forget to eat and I also believe there are people who still feel hunger even after eating an appropriate amount of food. Why don't the people with the uncontrollable ravenous hunger get to be slim and satiated like I do?",
          "Fullness and voracious hunger at the same time are also a lesser-discussed symptom of GERD. May be worth looking into.",
          "I have the same issue. But it wasn’t just the appetite that got me up to my highest weight. Your food choices also influence your appetite. But yeah I’m super jealous of the people that never even had to think about it.\nI really like Kiana Docherty on YouTube, she has very educational videos about reducing your appetite by addressing your habits and it all scientifically backed. She always includes sources. \n\nExamples:\n- eating high fibre and protein in the morning because it digests slower and doesn’t trigger your ghrelin response as much\n- drinking lots of water before and after eating to try to help you regulate your feeling of fullness when you have trouble regulating when you’re full\n- avoiding ultra processed, refined sugars, fast foods\n\nThose are the ones that stuck with me but there’s lots more especially about behaviour science.\nPersonally I also started drinking kambucha and eating more yoghurt to improve my micro biome and it’s helps a lot with appetite. But you could also have a thyroid issue and could consider getting blood work.",
          "You have to learn to eat the right foods, a lot of foods can be gorged on but are nutritious and fill you up and your brain will tell you your full. For example fruits/ vegetables and anything that’s almost pure protein. Eg chicken ,egg whites, Greek yogurt. The trick is protein. It’s what controls our hunger , that and fibre. I believe as humans we don’t truly feel full until we have eaten our protein requirements. Try binging on egg whites or chicken breast and tell me how it goes, I bet you can’t eat more than 2000 calories of it.",
          "The hunger im talking about is actually 100% physical hunger pains; like my stomach acid is ready to burn through my stomach and i start to feel nauseous. Mentally? I could not care less about food; i dont like eating during the day much anyways, i mostly do it to avoid the pain.\n\nSo there’s no actual cravings or anything. Theres no mental component to it, i just feel incredibly sick, and then emotionally/mentally im now annoyed because i have to go throughout the rest of the day like that. Physically when im full? Yeah. Just feels heavy. And i don’t feel… empty? If that makes sense.",
          "It means you aren’t eating enough or not eating the right foods to satiate you.\n\nMove to a maintenance number to recover then restart the deficit either smaller or look hard at what you are eating, volume eating like salads are fantastic options for me at least.\n\nUltimately if you are that hungry something isn’t right so stop, recover, reevaluate.  I had to do that recently when I wasn’t eating enough and it caught up to me, your situation sounds similar.",
          "Get ok with being hungry. I never feel full anymore and that is ok.",
          "what does that hunger feel like?",
          "I did one meal a day fasting with black coffee in the morning. In the beginning it wasn't so much that I wasn't hungry, I just ignored it. I've been doing different types of intermittent fasting for close to 3 years now. At this point when I ignore hunger it does go away. Hunger used to be a feeling in my stomach, an emptiness mixed with a tightness. I would eat when I felt that. Now that isn't Hunger for me, in fact being even slightly too full is uncomfortable. Hunger for me now is when I'm light headed, when I'm shaking or extremely irritable. I don't really register the other type of hunger. I still get it, but it is like body white noise. Truly I don't understand the people who can do multiple small meals, that makes me more hungry and amplifies the empty stomach feeling. Everyone is different.",
          "What do you mean by hunger? Do you find yourself specifically seeking out high sugar/high fat food?  \n\nHow do you feel when you're full? It should be like a heavy sensation in your stomach and the feeling of not wanting to eat. If you've eaten a good bit, and don't feel that at all/still want to eat 20 minutes later, it might be psychological hunger masking physical hunger and you should consider bringing that up with your dietician.",
          "I had this revelation when I was pregnant. I'd feel hungry, but then quickly feel full. Finishing what was on my plate was not an option, it would be too uncomfortable. Normally, I finish everything on my plate, easily pushing past small fulness signals. I actually lost weight, weighting the same the day I delivered as the day I learned I was pregnant. Sadly, I gained it all back breastfeeding, where I was constantly feeling hungry, and the sleep deprivation made me crave sweets more than normal. It's so much easier to lose weight when your body is cooperating!",
          "Are you getting enough protein? When I increased my intake to 100g per day, a lot of those food cravings, thoughts, and emotions went away.",
          "Not intending to scare you, but that reminds me of that \"I'm gonna murder someone if I don't get food right this minute\" type of hunger I had in both my pregnancies, but never before or since them. Although I (barely) passed the glucose tolerance tests, I assume this had something to do with blood sugar levels. Did your blood tests and other medical checks include blood sugar levels and other possible signs of prediabetes?",
          "I try to finish eating when still feeling hungry, and I never wait till I’m hungry to eat. On a scale 0 being haven’t eaten for days, and 10 being in about to split my sides I’m so full, I always try to stay between 4 and 7, and I always start each meal with a large glass of water or protein shake. So im already starting to feel a little full. This has helped me a lot after years of struggle. I’m so pleased to hear your story and I wish you all the best.",
          "For me this constant hunger was a symptom od ADHD. Meds for ADHD helped me to regulate my hunger and to learn what a normal portion size is.",
          "Anyone who has any success losing weight never says “just eat when you are hungry”.",
          "You are feeling this way due to your insulin levels. You are spiking them with carbs that only cause you to be hungrier than when you started, leading to your predicament of being ravenous in two hours. One solution is to get off the carb-rollercoaster, allowing yourself to become fat adapted and your brain starts using more efficient ketones rather than totally glucose for it's fuel. As an example, I am fat adapted and I can easily eat one meal in a day and then not be hungry for 23 hours until my next meal.  \n\nTLDR: Quit the sugar/carbs to stop feeling hungry all the time",
          "Just remember, you are not physically hungry, its in your head. If you are losing a pound a month, that is not starving. \n\nYou're dealing with a lifetime of overeating and what you thought was hunger and thats gonna take time.",
          "It’s okay to feel hungry, very little in nature is consistently full",
          "i literally have no idea what a hunger cue would even feel like. when i feel full it’s because i overate. every time. i really wish i could learn these feelings without medication or being super hungry all the time",
          "Brain fog, weakness, diarrhea, death. Obviously you'd have to get near zero fat to die, but brain fog and weakness are pretty easy to achieve by eating only 15g of fat/day. Your brain NEEDS fat to function.",
          "my appetite is dead. i rarely feel hungry, I TRY to eat around 1800 kcal per day (I think even 1800 is low for my weight and height) now I cant even eat 1800 kcal per day because I feel full, I eat around 1500 or 1600 and I hit my macros goals daily, I have to eat some more even when im full to get extra energy and lift heavy, I dont feel hungry at all, I eat at like 1 pm and and finish before 10 pm, sometimes I feel tired because there's no energy but im in no mood to eat\n\nI never thought these words would come out of my mouth because I used to binge eat a lot, like I'd eat around 10k calories a day\n\ndoes anyone else also feel like their appetite is dead?",
          "So this is either a physical issue or a psychological issue.  If it's a physical issue then the problem might be with the supply or reception of your hunger/satiety hormones.  You might need medication to regulate that system.\n\nIf it's psychological then your brain might be feeling a strong urge to eat and might be having trouble distinguishing the desire to eat from physical hunger.  Meds would probably help with that too, but if that's the issue then you might be able to deal with it like one would with other intrusive thoughts.\n\nYou should probably see your doctor so you can hopefully figure out whether it's the first problem or the second.",
          "Agreed. Have been on a 14 week (so far) cut and there are only 2-3 days where the hunger was seemingly abnormal or possibly too intense for optimum health. Other than that I’m just hungry every day lol. You get used to it. Hunger isn’t a bad thing and it’s not something that is indicative of something negative",
          "If you're only eating once a day of course you're hungry all the time.",
          "I know what you mean. The only answer for me is intense exercise. When I don’t exercise I can eat like 1700. When I do a group fitness class I eat 2400. I have been maintaining like this for 9 months now and put on a little muscle too. I lost weight eating 1300 and that was horrible…. I hate being hungry!",
          "Okay I think the first thing to think about is separation between mental hunger or taste hunger and body/physiological hunger. You seem to believe that you aren’t satiated by any amount of food because your MIND is saying “eat more”. However, you go on to say that you can feel nauseated and sick and STILL have your MIND telling you to eat more.  Then you say you’re “still hungry” after eating 5000 cals. \n\nBear with me here. What do you think of as “hunger”? Is it your mind saying “eat more”? Because that is a form of hunger (I would call it mind hunger or taste hunger or, honestly, a binge urge). This is different from physiological hunger and satiation. You can eat enough that your physical body isn’t hungry anymore, but you still want to eat. At that point it’s not about physical satiety but something mental - not that the body’s physiology isn’t still involved, like the desire to keep eating foods that taste good - but it’s not about whether you’ve physically had enough calories or protein or variety of foods. \n\nDoes that resonate with you? Or do you truly feel like “hunger” is the mind voice saying eat more?\n\nTo give you some examples - my body feels hungry when my stomach physically feels empty, I start feeling a bit irritable, I have less energy, etc. I can be physically satiated by a meal but still “want” something a little sweet. I may eat an ice cream sandwich and think I want another one, but once I eat that one I feel a little gross from the sugar (fuzzy teeth, headache sometimes). So my body didn’t necessarily want/need more, but my brain for whatever reason was like “that’s good I want more”. They’re separate things. It’s really hard to differentiate at first though.",
          "That is exactly right!!  It is assumed.  But strangely I am rarely hungry and don’t eat very much but can’t lose to save my life!!",
          "Hunger, or what we perceive as hunger, is a really interesting process.   \n\nEating is often a result of boredom, fixation (thinking about it), habit, stress, impulse, being thirsty..... we rarely often eat because we are truly hungry.  \n\nIt can be hard, but I've gotten quite good at simply ignoring hunger. I do not eat my first meal until 1 PM. I eat dinner at 5PM or 6PM. That's it. Almost never any snacks. If I have desert, it's with dinner.   \n\nI will routinely \"get hungry\" throughout the morning. By focusing on work and ignoring it, I can make it to lunch time without much issue. Once I get that first meal in my, I often find hunger is then no longer an issue until the next morning. Sometimes a tiny bit before I go to sleep, but not often.   \n\nAs they say, the first few weeks are the hardest. I'm about 7 or 8 days shy of two months now and I feel like I've got it licked. Trying to go OMAD might require a kick up in will power, but I find it un necessary as I'm averaging almost half a pound of weight loss per day over that span (a lot of which is water / due to the crap diet I had been eating before).",
          "Same thing happened to me with intuitive eating.  I gained weight quickly, it was the wrong approach for me.  I'm better off mostly avoiding those foods and trying to eat more fiber-rich produce heavy diet.",
          "Once you get to your goal weight, you should be able to eat at maintainence calories which may be higher than what you're eating now. Your stomach and appetite should slowly adjust to this lower level. You need to differentiate between hungry, satiated, and full/stuffed. Feeling full is a bad thing, you should be aiming to feel satiated or not hungry.",
          "Even if I wasn’t physically hungry after taking this magic pull, I would still want to eat for reasons other than hunger. I, and likely others as well, enjoy cooking and eating for more than just fulfilling hunger.",
          "I found for me it wasn’t actually hunger 2/3 of the time but just cravings for comfort food. Sometimes boredom. Sometimes blood sugar crashes because of smoking weed. Sometimes habit. Like “watching a movie would be better with chips”. I have to wait and see if my body is actually hungry IE growling stomach, feeling weak etc or if it’s just my brain tickling my addictive center for a dopamine rush. Lots of food overeating and craving for junk food etc is addiction based not hunger based cravings.",
          "If it's not too personal, what kind of doctors have you seen, and for what kind of treatment?\n\nIt's as far as I know freakishly rare, but there are genetic disorders that can mess with feeling sated, to the point of eating yourself to death. There can also be issues with this or that gland in your body due to hormonal imbalances or serious illnesses. \n\nIf you have not done this so far, maybe explore such possibilities with your treating physicians, or see if there is a pharmaceutical or surgical option available.\n\n1.5 years is a horribly long time to feel hungry...",
          "I have worried over the same thing. I had no desire to eat. Then would feel rundown. Now at least twice a day. 9 am and 3pm (based on my schedule) I drink a small 6oz 300 calorie meal replacement drink.  I don't like it. I dont want to. But it has made a tremendous difference for me.  Just my opinion. Good luck!",
          "Thank you. This is what I've been trying to explain to people for awhile. I experience the same thing when I completely cut out all sugar from my diet. The minute I add back sugar, my hunger goes haywire again. Yeah, it is super easy not to overeat when your brain isn't telling you to eat everything in sight. It isn't about willpower at all. There is no will strong enough to resist your brain saying you need to eat, stat! Versus when I don't eat sugar, I have no problems with willpower AT ALL. It's like \"meh, I could eat.\"",

Idk about others, but I can’t eat a high fat meal without feeling nauseous. For me there is a nausea factor that prevents you from drinking too much or getting that burger instead of a grilled chicken.  I’ve lost 15 lbs and it’s helped me with portion control and healthier options(because there are consequences if you choose otherwise).",

I used to be hungry all the time, now it’s rare\n\nEating time: try intermittent fasting. I used to have to eat when I wake up and lunch and dinner by specific times. Now I just give myself a range of time to eat. Usually 12-8. \n\nBored eating: still happens but I’ve replaced a lot of things with healthier more filling alternatives.",

Gratefruit (ruby reds), helped but they so does eating if the reflux is bad..(excess sugar can make the reflux bad)  Also Quit softdrink Or foods with aspartame or Phenylalanine,  one is the by product of the other.. and it inhibits Ghrelin which tells your body it is full or not..  when  Ghrelin is inhibited your in Fight or flight mode..  which is part of why the body is screaming...   Also do not eat more then 2 serves of veg per day.. Toxicity from veg's is an issue..   \n(It can kill your thyroid)  Also Try coconut powder milk or MTC oil with M8.. When you have a cuppa use it instead of sugar...   Some thing else Tea saucer servings, so smaller size meals...   Also  green tea and other foods can suppress hunger, like drinking water..  I would also see a psych, emotional eating can be caused by trauma or stress.",
          "Here is the thing: ever since I started eating healthy, I don't feel full or satiated. And on the very rare occasions when I do, I know I overate. You are not supposed to feel full. Intuitive eating only works once you learned what do you supposed to feel like when you ate **enough**. You only supposed to feel not hungry. It was mindblowing for me, but you really have to rewire your brain before you can be intuitive about eating. I don't do intuitive eating yet, but I have hopes I will be able to someday, after going on a company retreat where we ate in restaurants and had long nights out and I obviously couldnt track and still lost weight cause I was mindful and just stopped *before* I was feeling full.",

For example, have you ever been starving when you were waiting for the doctor or for your turn in the DMV?",
          "I’ve been in maintenance for over 3 years now. My appetite is a lot lower than it used to be and it really feels effortless. I don’t feel hungry and unsatisfied all the time.

Feeling sickly full and ravenously hungry at the same time is disgusting.",
          "You shouldn't be constantly hungry for the rest of your life.  When you're fat and used to binge eating an ass load of calories, you'll be hungry on a normal diet with normal food.  But you should eventually adapt to the point where you can eat around maintenance an not be hungry.  Being hungry sometime s in a deficit is normal, but once the weight is lost and you eat at maintenance you shouldn't be hungry all the time.  As little as 500 calories can mean the difference to me from never getting full and never being hungry.",

When I stay busy, at work or just engrossed in a hobby I love, I’m just not that hungry. Also, staying regularly active helps control my appetite A LOT. I’m just more aware of my body and how it’s feeling.\n\nRESET: I’ll fast the next day after overeating and that sort of helps me reset (no more than 16 hr fast), when I do eat, it’s a much smaller portion than when I was over eating and slowly work my way from there, listening carefully to my body, watching my energy levels and my strength training/cardio performance.\n\nYour body will adjust to ANYTHING. If you’ve made a habit of eating every 2 hrs, it will be hungry every 2 hrs. I strongly recommend intermittent fasting!

For me and some people protein really helps with satiety and curbs a lot food noise for some other people really focusing on volume eating and feeling full helps, you will probably have to experiment what works.\n\nSaying all of this though part of the equation is just time, any adjustment is going to feel most noticeable at the beginning but if you can find a way to stay consistent that feeling will dull over time.",

Some of it is a little too mystical/spiritual for me, but she does frame the issue well.\n\nThe thing that really helped me was learning to wait until my hunger cues kicked in. Not just eating on a diet schedule or number of calories. But waiting to eat until I was genuinely hungry, and sometimes that would take half a day or a whole day or a few hours. This really required relearning what those cues are and I'm still not great at it. (My mom has said that even when I was young I was terrible at noticing my hunger cues.) Then, when I realize I'm hungry, I made a conscious effort to listen to my body and what I was hungry for: protein or dairy or fruit or a salad or craving chocolate, etc. Hunger cues like your tummy rumbling or a headache or getting grumpy, etc.\n\nI also got better at not eating or eating something light if I was out with friends for a meal but wasn't actually fully hungry. It take a lot of personal and social willpower to just get a bowl of soup or an appetizer if you're not really that hungry, but everyone else is eating heartily.

Have your traced your micro nutrients (vitamins, minerals, etc.)? If you're deficient in an area, you might be craving food to satisfy that deficiency. This can happen on more restrictive diets. \n1. What is your daily sugar/fast carb intake? Food items like sugar, bread, potatoes, rice, pasta and food items a high glycemic index, can cause blood sugar fluctuations that trigger intense hunger and cravings.  \n\nI hope you figure it out! If it's none of these things, one \"trick\" that can help is to up the spicy heat in your meals using products with capsaicin, like jalapeno powder or hot cayenne powder. This will cause you to slow down and drink a ton more water as you eat, which will help you to feel full and satisfied. It's not the solution to the root cause, but it could help bridge the gap until you figure it out. \n\nGood luck and I hope this helps.",

          "Depends on what you mean by \"beaten\". As far as I can tell, it's a condition I'll always live with, but have to learn to manage. It's not a one time fix, it's more like brushing your teeth. If I don't keep up the management (like in times of extreme stress) then it will come back, but if I do keep it up, no problems. In that regard yes, I have found how to beat it.  \n\nI followed the book Overcoming Binge Eating by Christopher Fairburn. I followed his guidelines for months, now I only do what I feel works for me. I do suggest reading and following the book, but here's what works for me long term. \n1. I eat more often. Three SOLID meals a day plus multiple snacks. 2-3 hours is my sweet spot and yes, I set alarms if need be. I don't wake up hungry most days so that's the only time of day I go against his recommendations, but if I do wake up hungry I eat. And if I'm hungry during the day I eat. I don't willpower myself out of it, or some bullshit like that. I eat something substantial but healthy. Scheduling a meal or a solid snack every 2 (3 at most) hours keeps my blood sugar steady. \n1. Lots of protein spread throughout the day. I don't track it actually, but I eat a lot of meat and other protein high foods. Meat works best for me so that's in almost every meal. \n1. Planning. I think ahead to what I am going to eat. If I'm going to be running around I don't decide to \"get something while out\". That 100% always leads to overeating. I either package up a healthy meal to bring with me or I decide before what I will get at X restaurant. Last minute meal decisions are almost always bad for me. \n1. Healthy meals and snacks, not high sugary ones. I can have treats, but not stand alone. Every meal and snack I have involves protein and fat. If I have something sugary or treaty it will be with the meal or snack, not instead of. Basically, it's dessert. It's never a snack on it's own. \n\nAll of this worked for me and I didn't binge for over a year. Then I had a year of i",
          "This is my partner. We both are “recovered” from EDs but still suffer daily challenges. For me it’s body dysmorphia and binge eating (having previously suffered anorexia). Having a partner who doesn’t judge, only supports, and frequently reassures me that I’m beautiful the way I am is the only thing that keeps me from falling back into more restrictive habits. My binges are awful but he never makes me feel guilty or embarrassed. Ugh. I could cry it honestly means so damn much. Keep up the fight and kudos to your partner!!",

          "Has anyone actually beaten binge eating?. I have been binge eating for like 15 years and honestly I can’t take it anymore. I’ve tried every method I’ve come across including meditation, being kind to myself and forgiving the past, moderation, one day at a time, better than the day before and have dieted unsuccessfully for years because of it. \n\nI started therapy a year and a half ago and I just don’t feel it’s working for me I’ve had multiple therapists and nothing has changed at all. I’ve watched videos and podcasts about binge eating and discipline I’ve read countless books about habits and behaviour to try and figure it out. \n\nNone of it works though the worse thing is I don’t even like the food I binge on usually I always regret eating it after and sometimes before it happens and yet it still happens. Sometimes I’ll even have an argument in my head about whether I should do it or not and very rarely I decide not to I think I’ve made some kind of progress and the next day I’ll binge again it’s miserable. I live in hope that one day something will just click and I’ll never binge again but it never happens. \n\nHow did any of you overcome this sickness? What changed? ",

          "I’ll try to give you some advice I don’t see a lot of people saying. Stopping binge eating is a long term game. You get way more dopamine bingeing than you do not. Your real satisfaction comes weeks or months later. It comes with long term efforts where you feel proud of yourself. But that takes awhile. Make goals for yourself in other ways than food. Something that will take awhile but the reward will worth it. Learn a new hobby, save money for a trip, run a 5k, anything. The idea is you feel that sense of long term accomplishment and realize the work you put in and that time does move quicker than you think. These goals are obtainable if youre consistent and stick with it. Hopefully that transfers over to binge eating.",

I was stuck in a cycle of buy binge food -> binge because it's okay you'll stop tomorrow -> repeat\n\nFirst I started on a GLP-1. They can do wonders for addictive behaviors, and I was addicted to binging and food. Then I started to prepare all of my meals myself and completely quit any ready meals, frozen stuff, and UPFs, because those were my trigger.\n\nNow I do one meal a day, it's easy due to the GLP-1. I prepare it myself or it's leftovers from yesterday. My binge urges are all gone. I also cut out sugar (not really intentionally, just a side effect of quitting UPFs. I'm not a baker lol) and that probably helped too.",

It's basically cured my binge eating. I actually feel full now. Like I will be out to dinner with a delicious pasta dish and be like ok I'm good now let's stop eating and there will still be plenty of delicious pasta in front of me. I'm able to focus better. I find life so much easier being medicated. I used to struggle with overthinking things and getting lost in my head. I now meal prep every week. I'm down 50lbs in one year.",
          "I feel for you, this is the cycle I started with too. Don’t expect yourself to be perfect, and the process of beginning to lose weight fortunately does not demand perfection. It’s okay to mess up and have an off meal or day, but this attitude that allows you to give up after and continue with the binging cycle is not okay. Forgive yourself and move on, celebrate your wins, and over time consistency will improve and be rewarded. \n\nSome tips: \n\nAnalyse your behaviour. Why are you binging? Is your hunger uncontrollable, are you bored, is it a reaction to a bad moment/day? Address the cause of these, if it is hunger you are likely restricting too heavily and need to eat more and lose at a slower pace. Any progress is far better than no progress. \n\nHigher protein intake is good for satiety. \n\nDon’t punish yourself following a binge. It is not necessary to over restrict, just get right back to the plan. \n\nThe day after a bad day is not day 0. \n\nThis is a long journey but a rewarding one. Do not focus just on the finish line, you will find improvements in your quality of life and other wins to celebrate along the way. \n\nIt is very possible for you to change, don’t give up.",
          "What’s the root cause of your binge? Does food act as a source of comfort for you when you’re stressed? Or is it for you to have some form of control in your life? Did you manage to narrow down potential triggers behind your binges in therapy? It’s a lot trickier to overcome binging when you’re not dealing with the root cause, at least in my experience",
          "I've had mild to moderate binge eating on and off for years. It was more disordered eating than the clinical disorder. It would usually get worse if I had been on a restrictive diet of any kind or if I had a lot of trigger foods around. For me personally the thing that has helped me the most is intermittent fasting and extended fasting.\n\nAt first I actually did overeat a lot while fasting, because my body kind of went crazy and didn't know when my next meal, so I binged, but after about 2 weeks, it realized it was still going to get food regularly and the amount of food naturally came down to a more reasonable level. \n\nIf fasting sounds too extreme or you don't think it will work for you, the other thing that helped me in the past was actually making sure I ate 3 meals a day (no more no less). I know these kind of sound like opposite strategies, but at the end of the day I think it's just letting my body know it's going to get normal amounts of food and calories on a predictable regular basis. \n\nAlso, I keep binge worthy food away, think certain chips and sweets in family sized amounts. If I do have any, it has to be in a small amount so once it's done, I can stop, vs feeling like I can't stop eating until the entire family size bag is empty.\n\nNot sure if any of these will work for you. Once again, it was not clinical. I wasn't overweight except for a 2 year period in university where it was really bad (after a break up) and I gained 25 lbs in 3 months and had to implement the 3 normal meals a day method. I would continue to talk to your doctor and maybe a nutritionist.\n\nETA- It took me decades to get out of the habit of overeating and binge eating, but I finally did it last year at 37!",
          "Honestly, I had to unlearn any dieting rules whilst recovering from binge eating. It's only 6 years into recovering that I can finally start counting calories without crashing. \n\nThese resources enormously helped me and they're both free:\nBrain over Binge - her older Blogposts and podcast are great. I never bought the book as I didn't have the need\nLife After Diets - podcast available on Spotify etc \n\nYou need to learn what your triggers are, learn to eat foods again you previously had \"banished\" etc. \n\nFor me it was a long process but really worth it and I haven't now binged in a good year or so. Wishing you best of luck!",
          "Food addiction and binge eating as a coping mechanism arr different issues. Maybe you have both, or maybe just one. Do you know if it is both or just one?",
          "I beat binge eating while losing weight by ensuring I eat \\*enough\\* calories on each day. I found out that on some days I just ate too little and was getting hungry and out of control in the evenings. After I realised that sometimes I ate food that has just too little calories, I learned to make sure there is enough calories on each meal and this helped a lot.\n\nAnother thing that helped me was to always have fresh veggies and fruit. When I feel I need to eat something in the evening, rather than fight whether I want to eat or not I will just start eating fresh fruit in veggies. Not perfect, but not even nearly as bad as an alternative.\n\nThat said, there are different reasons for binge eating and different people are triggered by different things. You need to figure out what causes you to binge and how to prevent that.\n\n\\> I’ve read countless books about habits and behaviour to try and figure it out.\n\nHave you tried Mini Habits for Weight Loss by Stephen Guise? This is the one that helped me the most.",
          "I just finished the book Never Binger Again and found his method really interesting. \n\nBasically the idea is that you separate your food thoughts from yourself. Give it a name. He calls his The Pig. I think I might call mine The Blob. And you imagine this voice in your head as like, your arch nemesis so whenever it’s like ‘eat that whole pack of chips’ you can be like ‘stfu Blob’. \n\nI gave it a go yesterday and it was kind of cool! It’s the most in control I’ve felt around good in a long time. Like knowing all my thoughts are not me makes it much easier to ignore them.",
          "To aid temporarily I would suggest checking out r/bingeeatingdisorder",

          "I worked on it a fair bit over the years. Quitting smoking weed was a big one. I also made a rule that if I drank alcohol I couldn’t eat anything for the rest of the night after my first drink. I switched out some of my more calorie dense favorites for lower cal options. Etc. All helped but none fully cured it. \n\nI started taking a glp1 med in May and haven’t had a single binge since though. I still have 20 lbs to lose, and I don’t know how I will handle maintenance yet, I may need to stay on a low dose forever, I don’t know. \n\nIt has helped a lot with how I see and approach food though. I feel like I’ve built new habits that I should be able to stick to even without the drug. Again, I’m not there yet, so I just don’t know, but if you’re looking for an immediate solution while exploring the mental/emotional side, it at least gives you practice on what “normal” eating feels like.",
          "My binge eating is usually emotional eating. So planning meals, drinking water etc all help but recognising I am feeling those emotions that lead to eating, implementing other strategies E.g a quiet time in nature, a short burst of exercise, a quick cuppa and an online game or Netflix sitcom or working on a hobby which keeps my hands and mind just busy enough help. Also doing a routine household task like laundry or vacuuming keeps me busy. I then have a cuppa and a small snack. I serve up a smaller meal so I can go back for ‘seconds’ if I want them but make myself wait 20 minutes. \n\nBut also, often I think I am hungry when I’m thirsty so drink before eating.",
          "Me too, im binging so bad. Need help",
          "I binge when I make a mistake. Any food mistake. I spiral, thinking \"well I already messed up, so I might as well eat everything in sight\". \n\n So I avoid it by never making mistakes. It's my only option. I need to be disciplined all the time.\n\nIf it's happening every time you eat, here's my suggestion: stop before you eat. When you are sitting there, looking at the menu / looking at your food, you need an interrupt. It does no good to think \"I want to lose weight\" all the time, except when you're going to actually eat. \n\nThat's the most important time to think about it. So that's how I broke that cycle. Before you take even one single bite, just wait. Wait a second. This is the time to be intentional. Stop and think about what you want to actually do here.",
          "My relationship with food has no guilt, obviously as a result of not being overweight, and I don’t have disordered eating. So I obviously cannot relate to those of you that DO have such disorders. \n\nI have always had frequent times where I’ve eaten tons of food in one sitting? I don’t call it a binge and it has never occurred to me to call it that. I will always be that way so to answer your question I guess I have no desire or method to ‘beat’ that tendency. The term binge has connotations of guilt, disorder and lack of control and I don’t feel those emotions hence I just say I eat a lot, have a big appetite, can eat for days, never get full etc. \n\nAll I can do is describe my eating. I can’t go to sleep hungry. I regularly raid the fridge at midnight and speed-eat all the cheese or the equivalent of two extra meals literally just bc I’m sleepy and want energy but haven’t gone to bed. If I meal prep something and it’s delicious I will eat all the servings in one sitting bc it tastes good. I eat when I need motivation to meet a deadline. I have adhd. If there are 36 cookies on a tray, I will eat them all. I am aware that the whole tray is not an accepted serving size so maybe I feel bad for being selfish and forgetting anyone else who was expecting to get a cookie. But I don’t feel bad about liking cookies and being a black hole of treats 😂",
          "Honestly, I still binge. I've lost 60lbs so similar to yourself. I'll even binge on foods I don't particularly like. The only way I'm managing my weight is IF and ADF. At least when I do binge the damage is negligible and less food makes me feel stuffed faster. Not a great answer but I'm trying to be truthful with myself too. You aren't alone x",
          "You need to address the bingeing before addressing weight loss.  Otherwise, you'll stay stuck in this cycle.  Bingeing can be driven by lots of things, but a lot of binges occur because of over-restriction.  You eat too low calories and cut out treats for a few days and eventually your brain rebels.",
          "I’m not sure if this will help, given that you’ve already done a lot of research, but I found the Brain Over Binge podcast very useful.",
          "You literally have eighty million comments so it feels silly to add anything but this is a continued struggle for me as well. A few things that have helped me a little bit. \n1. I hate counting calories. It will make me quit and spiral because I’m so overwhelmed and angry. What I’ve been doing recently is only eating once or twice a day. Even though I’m not strictly counting, just by virtue of eating fewer times a day, I usually manage to consume a deficit. I know I’ll probably have to transition to something more exact but if I start all the extremes at once in more likely to drop everything. \n1. My most dangerous times are by myself late at night. One counselor suggested brushing my teeth as a way to signal my brain that we’re done eating. Maybe this is particular to me because I’m a little crazy about my teeth but it’s something. \n1. I got a calendar. Each night, if I got through a day without binging, I add it to my total. Like, in the little square tonight I’ll write a 20 or whatever day I’m on. Seeing the total get bigger makes me want it to keep getting bigger. And I’m not counting perfect days or days that that the scale goes down. Just counting how many days in a row I can go without a binge. Right now I aim to make it at least a month at a time. And I hope to keep raising that number. \n\nThere’s always a million suggestions, from people who get it and people who don’t. I hope at least a couple of them are ones that work for you.",
          "I did work with a HAES / intuitive eating therapist and overtime, it did help. We focused on de-stigmatizing food, a path to no longer eating in secret, and a focus on what to incorporate in each meal to curb hunger swings. \n\nTracking food always caused me to binge so I don’t do it. \n\nOne day I was talking to her about feeling stressed about a party and the food being around and staying in control and she said point blank, “what if I told you it’s just food?” And that simple yet profound statement was a lightbulb for me. It’s just food.\n\nIt took time. And I’m not perfect nor will I ever be - but binges are way fewer and far between now.",
          "I would end up binging if i cut either of those out. So unfortunately not. But i do mostly focus on the stuff you mentioned anyways, i just can’t completely deny myself sweets",
          "I mentioned in another comment I struggled for years with terrible binge eating. I got diagnosed with ADHD last year. As long as I am medicated, I don't struggle with binge eating anymore. I still get hungry and enjoy food but I'm able to stop eating. Part of me thinks my ADHD brain was just too loud and noisy to hear the hunger signals my body was sending before. \n\nI have always drank a lot of water when I eat. I still do. Try drinking a large glass of cold water before every meal. Fill your stomach up with water before eating. Some people find seltzer works better at giving a full feeling. \n\nIf there are particular foods that you are prone to binge eating do not keep them in your house. My apartment is an oreo free zone. I will eat an entire sleeve of oreos without even realizing it. So if I'm really wanting oreos I'll go to the convenience store and buy a tiny package of oreos so even if I eat all the oreos there's only 6 of them. Single serving size food items really help me feel complete. I'm a lot better now but for years I could not handle having half eaten food in my kitchen. It would keep me awake thinking about how there were still potato chips in the bag that I could be eating right now.",
          "The only thing that works for me to avoid any behavior is get rid of the problematic thing or walk away.\n\nSo if I feel like eating, I go to another room and/or at least start doing something that is somewhat important so that I \"forget\" to binge.\n\nAnd some foods I just don't buy anymore.",
          "Finding other options you can engage for sensory seeking is really important. Outlets like dancing, tactile art or even texture exploration can distract from the urge to binge.\n\nAnd even accommodations to allow for it when you really need to, but more nutritious. Like, if I knew I wanted to crunch & chomp on a bunch of chips, for that experience more than any hunger, I'll let myself eat a serving of chips ALONG WITH other more nutritious food, like carrots or celery (crunchy stuff I like but is actually nutritious) or maybe just those more nutritious foods by themselves.\n\nBeen trying out the \"have what you want, add what you need\" mindset to avoid unnecessary restrictions, because those restrictions have a counterproductive influence of leading to binging episodes. It's a practice.",
          "Do you calorie track your binge episodes? I had the same issue, and sometimes I’d overeat all weekend or even for multiple weeks because I was able to ignore what I was doing. Now?

          "I’m interested in neuroscience because it helps me understand where the urge to binge comes from. The Brain Over Binge podcast and Half Size Me YouTube episodes on lower brain chatter were very informative and helpful. \n\nIt’s easier to deprioritize urges when I know they’re the result of a brain related stress event. Thoughts & urges sometimes don’t require immediate action & I can take a few seconds to assess the reality of the situation.",

Honestly I'll binge eat or drink a lot of beer here n there and it doesn't hurt my progress at all as long as I stay hitting the gym and going for walks. Planning on binging calories actually is more helpful to me compared to snapping and turning into the cookie monster. I'll do some serious weight training the night before and in the morning go for a good run that way what I'm consuming later is at least going somewhere I want. Or it's a placebo and it makes me feel better about it. Either way I'm a happy camper.",

          "Hi, I have a friend who is a nutritionist and here is what she told me.... If you have binges then you need to address it either via a nutritional check (missing vitamins or minerals maybe? Vitamin D, Chrome, Magnesium, B12 are key for increasing metabolism, cravings and losing weight) and if all normal then it could be you eat because you are bored at home. So keep busy (no Netflix binge watching) or do some therapy or coaching to address this. Also for women, realise that we have 4 phases in our menstrual cycle, so we need to adapt our eating to avoid cravings before our period for example). Water is so important - if you realise that you feel thirsty every day, then its already too late, your body is already dehydrated. Drink 2L of water a day. Also eat vegetable or animal protein - key to reducing hunger! Lots of fibre through eating beg, fruit, nuts, grains etc... And no sugar/carbs after 16h00..... and move move move....10,000 steps a day or exercise (not cardio/running on its own as it stresses the body - more High intensity training with weights)...\n\nRegarding my Ozempic experience .... I have hypothyroid, metabolic syndrome and PCOS and over the past 18 years my weight has gone from 60 kilos to 87 kilos at my highest (plus pregnant with two kids). I was doing everything I listed above....exercising 3 times per week (HiiT), doing 30 min walks most days and eating healthy, not smoking and not drinking alcohol. However my weight continued going up. Nothing I did worked including taking Metformin. Last year I was feeling unwell, my BMI and bad cholesterol were very high and I was feeling miserable. So my doctor put me went on Ozempic 8 month ago. I lost 17 kilos in just 6 months. It was truly AMAZING! BUT and there is BUT...at one point the weight loss stops obviously....and then you need to be on a maintenance dose. And if you want to stop....well the weight creeps back up slowly but surely. I have gained back 3.5 kilos in one month! So make sure you inform yo",
          "TW: ED It took me several years to stop binge eating. I used to be bulimic in high school and that eating disorder turned into a binge eating disorder in college and I gained a ton of weight. I got up to my heaviest weight in 2018 at 179 kg and had tried to lose weight several times, but couldn't stop binging. I ended up doing keto from 2018-2019 and that helped a bit because I felt really satiated from the amount of fat and protein I was eating. I then took a break from weight loss until 2023 when I started CICO. It was really hard and I still had days where I binged, but they were becoming fewer and now I don't binge anymore. It took me 6 years to lose 72 kg (still losing weight).   \n\nBinge eating used to be my coping mechanism for stress and anxiety but it no longer is. I recently went through a traumatic event and was worried that I might go back to binge eating, but I've been focusing on walking instead and that has helped distract my mind.

          "i've struggled with binging in the past, and saying \"just don't binge\" isn't always quite that easy. OP, you really need to examine what conditions lead you to binge in the first place and develop safeguards to prevent it from happening in the future. you've recognized the problem, but now you have to take responsibility for implementing the solution or you're just going to drive yourself to hopelessness and give up altogether.\n\nfor me, i realized that alcohol combined with THC were major catalysts for spurring binges. cutting alcohol altogether and limiting THC to weekends has all but removed my binge habits. enjoying THC on the weekend is fine, but my key is knowing that the true danger of the munchies is starting to eat period. having a cut-off time for eating in the evening and general meal planning is huge in this regard. if i were in your position, i would cut both until i generated some progress; plus, alcohol is bad for you for a myriad of other reasons and i would recommend cutting it out to anyone, especially someone who is struggling with their weight. \n\nthe second most impactful thing I've done is sticking to a (mostly) whole food diet high in protein and fiber, with most of my calories back-loaded for my evening meal. in the past when i would binge it was always a late night thing, and it's really hard to even want to eat after housing a chicken breast, 3 eggs, half a cup of rice and 3-4 servings of asparagus and broccoli. i often cap with a glass of skim milk to get that slow-digesting protein in my system for bedtime. at that point, i'm too full to even fit anything else in my body. this doesn't mean you need to eat totally clean on the weekends, but be smarter about it. Chipotle done the right way can be a great way to scratch that eating-out itch while filling you up enough to keep you satisfied for a long period of time. experiment and come up with recipes that make whole foods taste amazing; seasoning is calorie free, there are plenty of low-calor",

          "So I’m 57F, I started binge eating at around 16/17, after a very restricted period of eating.  This lead to me yo-yo dieting for the next 40 years, after each diet and the weight piled on again, I’d get a little bit heavier each time.  I started out originally just wanting lose 10lbs, this year I was approx 120lbs over weight. \nBut this year I also (as I started Ozempic) re/started counselling to look at my food (addiction).  Although I’ve had therapy before to try and help with this.  This time it has just ‘clicked’.  \nI am hoping that the skills and techniques  I’m learning, will help me stick at it when I reach my goal.  \nThese include:  thinking about your feelings before you start to binge eat (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired = HALT).  It include the simple idea or not having and crap food in the house, especially if you have ‘known’ food that you tend to binge on? It includes journaling and even just being kind to yourself?  \nI used to use these periods of binge eating to really internally ‘kick myself when I was down/ negative self talk’.  It’s about learning to be kind to yourself and being your own best friend.  It’s also about techniques like the ‘drama triangle’  - I used to find myself dragged into to everyone else’s drama and finding it so stressful, that it’d lead to binge eating.  \nBut honestly, once I get to goal weight, I’ve no idea if this will work, but it’s trying to just add another tool to my tool box.",

Or go to a nutritionist/dietician that specializes in binge eating and they can tell you how to balance meals that can help make you feel full.

          "There's a podcast called We Only Look Thin that you might like. The hosts are a married couple who have each sustained weight loss of over 100 pounds, and Catherine specifically talks about binging.\n\nSome of her advice I can remember is that she gives any indulgent food 3 strikes: if she can't moderate herself with it 3 times, it's out of the house and she won't have it in the house. She said she heard in a support group the phrase \"don't take the devil home with you\" and that advice stuck with her. At the very least, it means you're putting more steps between yourself and a binge because you'd have to go out to do it. You want to make it as hard as possible, so don't have credit or debit cards stored on any food delivery sites and consider deleting any phone apps you have.\n\nIntentionally explore methods of unwinding. Maybe you journal, meditate, take your dog for a walk, or put on a podcast and start cleaning, but treat it like you're doing a behavioral science experiment with yourself. Maybe at the end of the day or week, you reflect on what went well, what needs work, and any ideas to try the next time.\n\nEdit to add: Donald said he had to start going to bed at 10pm because he'd want to eat things the later he stayed up, and of course, it was never vegetables and fruit he was eating late.",
          "Actively restricting doesn't mean being hungry. For a lot of people they keep eating past the point of being full, and only stop when they are stuffed. \n\nSo you have to learn what \"full\" feels like. But as you stop binging, your stomach will also shrink and less will make you feel more full. \n\nBut I would challenge whether you actually need the amount you eat to stop hunger pangs. You probably eat at times when you're not feeling hunger pangs, and you also probably eat well past no longer being hungry, into feeling full and past until you're stuffed. \n\nMost people don't keep eating until they feel full. They eat until they no longer feel hungry. For someone who binges the idea of that is totally foreign. They only stop eating when they can't eat anymore. \n\nJust like an alcoholic doesn't stop drinking until they are drunk. I don't drink to get drunk. I drink one or two drinks and stop, three if I'm really going crazy. I don't get drunk, I don't get hangovers. The idea of continuing drinking until I can't drink anymore is crazy. \n\nThat's what binge eaters are doing. They don't eat to stop hunger, they eat to binge until they can't fit anything else in and they are in a food coma. Then they have the food equivalent of a hangover in a few hours, and need to eat again to feel better. \n\nThe hard thing is that an alcoholic can just stop drinking all together. You can't do that with food. But you don't get to eat to stuffed every meal, the same way that it's okay to drink but it's not okay to get drunk every night.",

Its a serious mental health condition, you feel a loss of control when overeating. and I will eat multiple large meals in short time frames.\n\nGrab a journal and start recording your binge episodes. write the feelings before, during, after. \n\nRemoving the distractions and influence of food is the biggest part to recovering from this. You also need to be kind to yourself. Don't rely on ADHD medication for weight loss that's silly. Losing weight is a lifestyle change there is no single pill that can fix it. You need to make the change yourself. Being honest is the first part.\n\nI found most success in eating frequently throughout the day, 4 -5 meals a day. Breakfast - little lunch - lunch - afternoon tea - dinner. No food/snacks after 7-8pm. Drink a gallon throughout the day. \n\nIn saying that I still have episodes of bingeing where I feel so powerless and defeated, but you do recover, you will get back on track, you will continue your weight loss journey. \n\nI think like others are saying you need to speak to psychologist.",

          "I used to binge eat horribly. It's gotten much better since I started making a real effort to change my thinking. It's hard and I'm not always successful at it but I'm making progress. I've had specific harmful thought patterns regarding food for my entire life, it's going to take time for my brain to rewire.  \n\n Basically, I had to learn that food is not finite. It's not going anywhere. It sounds silly but for example, I really wanted a cupcake but was already full. Reminding myself that I could simply return the next day to have the cupcake helped me have more control and make better decisions. I made sure to actually follow through the next day and get the cupcake. The follow through helped solidify that it truly isn't a big deal to skip out on something.  \n\n It wasn't until I made changes like that I started to binge eating significantly less. CICO helped me lose a ton a weight many years ago and thankfully I never returned to my highest weight but it also never helped me fix my relationship with food at all. I recently tried CICO again and was absolutely miserable. I just can't, it was starting to affect my mental health negatively. I ditched it and started doing what is described above and I'm so much better for it. I don't expect the weight to melt off but it's much easier to maintain these small but significant lifestyle changes and lose weight slowly. \n\nETA: also, stop the negative self talk. We all do it from time to time but if it's the main way you think about yourself and food choices you're really making lasting change difficult. You need to make decisions out of self love, not self loathing. If I have a bad day or even week eating wise, I recognize it, acknowledge it, and then remind myself I can treat myself better because I deserve it. I don't beat myself up over it, or attempt to punish myself for it by forcing myself to eat less or exercise more. \n\nOn the topic of exercise, I treat it _completely_ separate from weight loss/maintainence.",

I still had them after I got off the meds so the meds didn’t cause them but definitely escalated binge behavior)\n\nTherapy\n\nMeditation\n\nI am also doing something right now where I’m practicing leaving food on my plate. I was raised to regularly east past fullness because I had to “clean my plate” even to the point of being made to sit at the table for hours past dinner as a child until I finished. And I was punished for wasting food. Which led to me always finishing food even if I was full or didn’t like it that much. So at dinner now I choose to leave 1-2 bites of food behind. Just to get comfortable mentally with that.\n\nI tell myself “I can have more tomorrow. I don’t have to eat it right now”\n\nI also try not to keep trigger foods in the house. Holidays can be hard with this. I did have one binge day this past Christmas.\n\nTrying to recognize the difference between “overeating” (which everyone does sometimes) and a binge. For me that line is hiding it. If I’m hiding how much I’m eating from those around me, sneaking things in secret, it’s a binge.\n\nHaving a plan for interrupting a binge if it’s started or, preferably, heading it off before it starts. I do things like drink something warm - herbal tea, coffee, low calorie hot chocolate, bone broth, miso soup - and find another activity. Video games work well for this. My binge urges mostly strike at night so things like working out or going for a walk usually aren’t available.\n\nEven if a binge has started I tell myself “you didn’t destroy the day. You can stop right now.” And sometimes that works to interrupt the “well I already messed up so I may as well binge",

For about 3 weeks, i had at least one cookie everyday, even if i didn’t want the cookie i would force myself to eat one; this helped subconsciously teach me that these foods weren’t superior, they weren’t rewards, they weren’t punishment… they were simply food. Most of my binging comes from restricting or emotional eating; so i stopped restricting too much(but stayed in a calorie deficit) and got my ass in therapy.\n\nI still sometimes struggle with the emotional aspect, but i’m learning new coping mechanisms, and everyday i feel less and less tempted; i’m able to successfully stay in a deficit without counting, simply because i can be mindful now.",

I’ve started keeping healthier alternatives of high calorie foods that don’t make me binge, but I enjoy on occasion around. (100 calorie icecream bars/veggie+apple straws in individual 100 calorie bags to satisfy the need for crunch). For problem foods that I typically binge on, I keep one and only one of the smallest available size of the item around or any healthier alternative that still satisfies the itch (They make individual portioned meals of a lot of my binge foods), and I’ve started cooking smaller amounts and pre-weighing/logging my ingredients as I prepare to cook to eliminate leftovers (having leftovers has historically lead to me just binging leftovers out of boredom/convenience/coping with negative emotions). I ate myself over 400lbs and luckily my mindset has shifted, that’s the most important thing, but you have to take steps to prepare for binges.

Again, for building muscle and not at a caloric deficit. I get it's counter-intuitive but I think you want to see if your body CAN and also, more muscle helps with fat loss (this is why bodybuilders bulk then cut.) 1200-1400 calories is likely on the low side depending on your height, current weight, and daily activity level but you sound active so I think your cals and protein need to be higher.\n\nBreaking bones is interesting esp if you have been lifting (compound lifts?) since those should be increasing your bone density - although you mentioned cutting out dairy.

Don't beat yourself up about others being able to do more. That's not actually relevant to you, because you're doing the most *you* can, and it's enough. Plus. Honestly, how far do you think any of those people you see strolling around would get if they had to move an extra 100+ lbs around everywhere? It's hard! You're working hard just being you, and it's no wonder you have limitations compared to others.\n\nIf you have access to a physical therapist, that would be an excellent source of advice about exercises that would be right for you as you work on this. If not, it's okay, just keep walking because you actually *can* still do it, just not so very much of it. And maybe deliberately doing shorter stints would be better than feeling like you're failing at something bigger.

Progress is never linear, with weight loss or anything else, until you zoom out over a period of months or years. \n\nI want to push back a little about one thing you said. An hour walk may not be realistic every day. But what about 20 minutes? That won’t make or break your weight loss, but you might start feeling better physically, and it certainly won’t make you feel any worse.

Don’t torture yourself with walking, there’s lots of gentle exercise videos on YouTube.

I'm in the 350lb+ area and I was in an abusive household for the last few years of my life - the last six months left me basically immobile, stuck in a state where I didn't move at all from my bedroom due to intense depression.\n\nI've now moved in with my partner of a few years and in a much healthier (mentally) place. It's a quiet village with lots of wide open spaces and generally just a peaceful place. My partner has been very, very good to me and incredibly supportive during my transition here. However when we go for walks I can only last about 5-10minutes before I need to go back. And that five-ten minutes is maybe just a few meters down the street. I feel awful and embarassed on behalf of my partner that I just cannot walk far and I really, really want to change this.\n\nIs there any gentle starting places for me at this rate? I'm terrified i'm at the point where I just can't go back and i'm basically doomed to be over 350lbs forever and unable to barely do anything from myself. I don't want this for myself and I don't want this for my partner either.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated grately.

Walking alone, it cut 20-30 minutes off what had been an hour and 45 minutes. Then I was in an accident (passenger on bus that hit a pole), and had to take taxis home for about 6 weeks. I think in those 6 weeks that the diabetes the walking had kept quiet blossomed with the stress and inactivity, because the first time I tried walking again the entire bottom layer of my feet peeled off…I had to apply duct tape to simply walk at all.

It thrives in high sugar environments and when it doesn’t get sugar, it releases chemicals into your body that gives you headaches and withdrawal symptoms. \n\nEven if you get caffeine elsewhere, you would still go through withdrawal while those bacteria died off. \n\nYou can get caffeine in a pill form, as coffee, I have these chocolates that are pretty good at work. \n\nI suspect that like me, you have a sugar addiction and that is the problem.  \n\nLook into high quality probiotics, for a week or two before you try stopping, take the probiotics to start to repopulate your gut with good bacteria. Then, cold Turkey, stop. \n\nSome things that helped. I got a big ass water bottle that kept cold drinks cold for 24 hours.

I used to get iced coffees with breakfast sandwiches/bagels then have another bagel for lunch.  Then get a sandwich on the way home with a 12 pack of beer, some pretzel snacks and candy.  Then repeat every day saying I won't do that again... Did that for probably 12-13 years.  Now, I make own iced coffee/teas.  I have 0 calorie skinny syrups mixed with almond milk, water and instant coffee and they are so good!  I actually think Dunkin donut coffee is too sweet now!  I'll have eggs with salami and bread or Greek yogurt with granola and toast and avocado.  Then I spend a couple hours once or twice a month preparing delicious casseroles that I freeze in one cup containers.  These are really tasty like lasagna, taco lasagna, biscuits and gravy, hamburger, creamy chicken chili, cornbread chili, broccoli cheddar soup, enchiladas etc etc so much more!  Lots of recipes online.  So when I get home I have a freezer of 40 meals all different and something that sounds good.  I also precook and freeze shredded chicken, beef or pork so I can have basic meals like chicken and potatoes with broccoli or a side.  Then I always leave room for some chocolate.  I have a large bag of Hershey kisses and I'll grab 5 with some mints and it tastes like peppermint bark.  Or I'll have a frozen fudge bar... Or a candy bar.  Whatever I have room for calorie wise.  Now, I think this is a great way to lose weight becauae you can still eat what you want.  I have lost 112 pounds this way.  I want to mention though, as I'm proud I've gotten this far BUT I am personally trying to move towards eating more healthy.

It's going to be unpleasant. \n\nThere is also no shame in using medication. Medication is not a magic bullet, you still need willpower and motivation, especially in the beginning. Very few of us overeat solely because we are hungry. Even if medication kills the ability to overeat, it will not kill the root of the underlying *desire* to overeat. There is still work to be done.

Without replacement sweet drinks I find that I craved regular soda less and it was way easier to give it up entirely.

What would be the community's advice?\n\nI have tried CICO, which worked for a while and made me lose +- 5 kg (11 pounds) over 8-9 weeks, but I've stepped away from it because my life turned into a giant numbers game everyday on what I could and couldn't eat/drink anymore and it made me feel bad. I gained it all back again in 1-2 weeks.\n\nI've been seeing doctors/endocrinologists who might be willing to subscribe me Ozempic, though none of them have been willing to do so. I figured if I have no constant hunger feeling, it might be easier to lose the weight and I also heard it helps with addiction.\n\nApologies if I seem unmotivated/undisciplined. I want to get better/healthier and I want to work for it, but at the same time, I want to remain a good/positive feeling/vibe in my life and not constantly hangry and frustrated throughout the process. Would that be possible?\n\nThis board has been very resourceful to me and I wish you all the best on your journey. It's so much tougher to people that don't have it come easy. I've run all the tests at the clinic and it turns out my BMR (basal metabolic rate) is very low for a person my age, despite a decent muscle mass (a little above average), so I'll likely always have more hunger than the amount of food I actually require.",

And how are you going about losing it? 6-7 pounds is a lot for two weeks, are you maybe pushing yourself too hard at the beginning? If you go for everything all at once, you're never going to feel like you're making progress, and you'll get these burnout moments. \n\nSince you seem pretty depressed and disheartened, maybe you should try something a little different for your next weight loss attempt. Next time, give up at the start on going all out. Don't worry about an ideal weight or looking a certain way. Right now, all you have to do is prove to yourself that you can lose weight and keep it off. Doesn't matter if it's a pound or 20 pounds. Set yourself a small goal to lose in 3 months and keep it off. Then, find 1 of your habits that is contributing to your weight problem, and replace it with a habit that encourages weight loss. And then focus on that. The benefit of doing it this way is that you'll be adopting healthier habits that will allow you to sustain any weight loss you achieve.  After that, you need to prove to yourself that you can lose the weight. Don't set a huge goal that is going to look impossible when you lack motivation, because that's where the burnout is coming in. \n\nJust going off my own experience as someone with ADHD, but it seems like when I set a big goal I want to achieve, I do so when I have lots and lots of motivation. But the moment I don't have that much motivation, it's almost impossible to stick to the things I said I'd do to meet that goal. But if I set a much, much smaller goal, the motivation barrier is way lower, and even if I don't feel like doing something, I can usually still make myself do it (with my medication). And that means lapses are rarer, and when they do happen they aren't as disheartening, because you only set yourself back on a month goal, you have lots of months left to get that goal done.

          "My best advice I can give is don't focus on your destination, focus on your journey. Instead of thinking \"I have to be 270 by june\", look yourself in the mirror and say, \"today, right now, I am losing weight\"\n\nLifting weights and cardio are awesome for physique and athleticism, great for your organ health, but you lose weight in the kitchen.\n\nThe simplest strategy is CICO - calories in, calories out. Start today, download a calorie counter like loseit or my fitness pal, and track everything you eat. If it goes in your mouth, put it in the app. This will give you a baseline of how many calories you're consuming daily, and will give you a guideline of how much you need to reduce. You can literally eat everything you're currently eating, just in smaller portions. People choose salads, keto, vegan, paleo, blah blah blah fad diets because those diets will have high volume, low calorie meals, giving them the \"full feeling\". You can do them if they work for you, but for most people, they are unsustainable over a long timeline.\n\nIf you're looking for some lazy tips, here's a few:\n1. Cut out sugar as much as physically possible. If it's prepackaged, look at the sugar content. If it has any, it's gone. The only sugar you can consume is if it has fiber, like raw apples and oranges (no juice!), which brings up my next point:\n1. Don't drink your calories. No pop, milkshakes, alcohol, starbucks, juice, prime, Gatorade, etc. 0 cal drinks are okay, but in small quantities as needed. Usually they're full of aspartame which has seen some carcinogenic positive studies in large quantities. Drink water, tea, black or 1 shot cream coffee (no sugar)\n1. There's been studies that show many people can't differentiate between being hungry or thirsty. Before you eat, drink a pint of water and wait 5 minutes. If you're still hungry, go ahead and eat. The water will help you feel fuller, faster anyway.\n1. Prepackaged foods like hamburger helper and potato chips are packed full of salt, fat,",

Would you crash your car if you were having a bad day? Think of that when you're feeling like breaking your diet. \n\nIf I were you I'd probably slow down on the more strenuous workouts for a bit. Activity is obviously very important as well, but at your weight, your heart can't take it. Just go for a walk for 20 minutes, a half hour, an hour, whatever you can handle. \n\nExercise is for fitness. Diet is for fatness.

Chronometer or loseit are great and work perfectly fine on the free version. \n\nSecondly, walking for 30 mins a day will do wonders, eventually you’ll like it and feel bad when you don’t. \n\nThose 2 things will make a huge difference especially tracking calories. You really don’t know how much you are eating until you count it. Having coffee in the morning with creamers? You could be consuming 30-200 calories just in your coffee, have coffee in the afternoon? Same thing only now you are at 60+ calories and you have not touched food yet.\n\nAdding food to these programs is easy and if you eat a lot of the same foods it is even easier, logging might take a little initially but once you start and get used to it, it’s like 1-2 minutes of your day.\n\nAnd lastly, you have to want it, not just like the idea, if you don’t really want to do it, you won’t.\n\nLike Nike, just do it!",

Find a way to consistently burn calories each week, and ensure you get what nutrients you need in comparison to what you want. Less sweet foods, more protein-rich, fibrous foods so you stay fuller longer and so your body can be kicked into a mode where it can easier burn fat. Of course if nothing else, you could always try and kick your body into ketosis. Which you can do in many ways besides just fasting for 72 hours. Anyways good luck!",
          "The most important thing is CICO. The second most important thing is to do a routine that works for YOU, that YOU can keep up with. You don't have to make it too complicated. Take your existing routine and make one change for a week. Then the next week add another. It's important to take time to build these habits because you will more or less need to keep up with them your whole life. As for how much to eat, pick a TDEE calculator. Eat at that number - 500 for a few weeks and see how much you lose. A 500 deficit should get you one pound of weight loss a week.

I started at 240 lbs and really thought I was only eating less than 2000 calories per day. It was confusing to me why I wasn't losing weight in a calorie deficit. I started weighing and tracking by gram and found out I wasn't in a deficit at all, and my calorie intake was more like 3000/day. You can definitely change your weight. Make it a lifestyle change so the weight stays off. Take advantage of all the help your insurance will give you, if that's access to a dietitian or a doctor who can draw labs for a baseline or medicine if you need it. Some insurance even gives you discounted gym membership or free online workout classes or discounted home gym gear like running shoes and yoga mats. You don't have to exercise to lose weight. 80% of weight loss happens in the kitchen. Exercise can help you feel less anxious and depressed which can lower how often you reach for food to comfort yourself.  \nYou can do this.

Either way, just keep going one day at a time.\n\nAlso, at risk of sounding like a cliche social media influencer, motivation is worthless. Determination and discipline is what will keep you going.

Remember that stress can also make you retain temporarily too. Women just don't have the luxury of taking those weights too seriously detail wise. We go on a range.\n\nTake a breather. Don't overthink it. You don't need to have to measure everything to the tiniest detail. Find a few recipes that work for you, learn to eyeball portions, and try to just eat less without overstressing. You've already gone a YEAR going through this, and it's a lifestyle. Your body should be more or less adjusted to the less calories now. I personally found that measuring every little thing stressed me out and made me feel like it was incredibly difficult and tiring. It might not work for everyone, so no promises here if my system \"works\", but you at the very least need to find what works best for you. I found that by observing how much I eat, and then taking away an amount, was way easier than measuring everything. E.g. skipping evening snacks, or no longer drinking alcohol, or making normal dinner but taking away 25%, or whatever. Like you eat the same minus one thing or two things until you find a flow. \n\nSo what if you gained a little, everyone goes up and down a little.

Think a few 30 minute morning walks a week or 3 full body strength training days. Keep it simple and not too difficult to start. I find that this helps with my daily energy levels and helps me sleep better.\n\nWeigh yourself at the same time every day and average it at the end of the week. I normally weight myself first thing in the morning after using the bathroom wearing just underwear. \n\nTake progress pictures either once or twice a week, and continue to do this throughout the weight loss journey. Take them preferably at the same time of day each time and in the same spot as possible.

          "I hate tracking. I won’t do it unless I’m not eating enough…\n\nAnyway my tips are:\n1. Set food boundaries.  I personally liked Whole30, an elimination diet where you cut out most processed foods and just ate healthy. Find one that works for you and keep with it for a couple months, then eat 95% healthy or what works for you and 5% whatever you want. I never would cut out my own birthday cake or thanksgiving meals… so don’t feel the need you must. \n1. Volume eating. Eat 60% clean healthy veggies and fruit and greens, raw-steamed-baked, eat it with herbs and spices and maybe some healthy fats like olive oil and some protein is important too. But eat as MANY as you can all the time. Fiber makes you full, it’s high in volume and low in calories and dense in nutrition often times. \n1. Intermittent fasting worked for me as a t2 diabetic who struggled with weight and hormones. I recommend it if it FITS your lifestyle. \n1. Don’t go hungry- don’t ever be too hungry long term.  As you’re adjusting to a new diet you may get hungry and irritated and it’s annoying but don’t ever quit eating, and don’t overindulge. It’s ok to be a little uncomfortable (because I’m t2 diabetic my hunger hormones never turned off. Ever… like I was starving most of the time, but it’s better to get a little hungry and not overeat at the same time. It’s hard) but don’t make yourself weak and sick from lack of nutrition. \n1. Healthy eating is the best. Be mindful of your health.  Sure it’s nice to lose weight and maybe necessary but your health is most important, see what’s wrong with you at the doctors office. If you have a problem sometimes that impacts your weight and how hard it’ll be to lose weight.",

When I calorie track I start just with maintenance calories and no weight loss for an entire month. This way I establish an rhythm and a routine without my brain freaking out that I’m starving myself. After that I do 500 below maintenance. If you’re a man it’s a lot easier the lose a pound a week than a woman. As larger man who is weight lifting it will be easier for you to do a 1,000 calorie deficit than most people. That’s 2 pounds a week. If you do that you will be 200 pounds in a year. If you can do a 500 calorie deficit you will be 250 in a year. \n\nMy mindset is I don’t need to lose weight or get anxious about doing it perfectly. I am developing new habits.

          "I didn’t go from one extreme to another super quick. Slowly build healthy habits. It isn’t motivation or determination, it’s discipline. I still really struggled with that because of depression/general laziness and got in my own head. When you start doing good for your body, eventually you will crave healthy habits and notice how it affects you. Almost nobody wants to go to the gym, but the feeling after is amazing. Don’t think that means you need to destroy yourself in there. If you’re there for 15 minutes even, that’s still progress and the hardest step. You just gotta show up. \n\nI would highly recommend to start by drinking more water. Sounds dumb, really helps. Your body will just automatically feel better. Dehydration affects you more than you’d think.\n\nCalorie deficit will be your best friend. You don’t need to cut out the things you love. Use the TDEE calculator to see what your maintenance is. (An even better option would be just tracking your calories the way you would normally eat for a few weeks to get your actual maintenance) Personally, I know what my goal weight is. I put in the information for what I WANT and got the new maintenance calories I’m shooting for. \n\nNext step depends on your personal preference. If going to the gym is harder, try incorporating a healthy hearty breakfast in the morning. If diets harder, try to go on walk. Build the habits that are easier for you and work up to the harder ones. \n\nWalking in general is great. Trying to get in a brisk walk can completely change your motivation levels. Wait for a nice day and go on a walk! The sun also works wonders for our bodies. \n\nChanging your mindset is key to weight loss. It’s difficult, but once you get there, you’re there. Some of my personal favorite eye opening quotes (more or less, but general ideas):\n- I’d rather be uncomfortable for 45 minutes a day with my body than every day of my life\n- If you don’t make the change, it will never happen\n- You have the power to reach your goal",

I know (especially in the weight loss sub reddits) we get really focused on calories, number on the scale, and tracking everything like crazy. While yes this is a perfectly adequate way to lose weight this doesn’t actually help any of the underlying issues in why you gained the weight. 90% of people gain the weight back after they lose it.  I know I added to those stats (twice now lost over 30 and gained it back, lost 25 and gained it back and then some). I know if a long term weight loss plan that is meant to change your lifestyle (which will change your weight) and calorie counting is like the finale boss level. Each step you will work through at your own pace and develop healthier habits as for long term success. \n\nStep 1 get your sleep in order. If your tired your going to eat more and you won’t have the energy needed to get things done. \n\nStep 2 drink enough water and decrease your empty calories for drinks. \n\nStep 3 increase your step counts. Track them for a week (don’t increase just see where you are) then increase them daily or weekly by 5-10% until your up to 8,000-10,000 steps a day. I don’t mean go for a walk to help get them in. I mean instead of sitting to fold laundry you’re going to stand. Need to get some housework done now is the time to get on it, any other projects hop to it. \n\nStep 4 find some exercise you actually like to do and would be upset for missing it. Like a class, hike, bike, swim, yoga, dancing, fencing, walking, softball, etc. there are SOOOOO many options and if you take the time you will find one. \n\nStep 5 (you will track this but it’s only 1 number so it’s super easy) increase your protein intake. It’s .8 grams for ideal body weight. This will decrease your appetite greatly and leave you feeling full longer. \n\nStep 6 figure out the veggies that you love to eat.

If you want to be 160lbs, you have to figure out how to eat like someone who weighs 160lbs, not like someone who is trying to lose weight. Does that make sense?           \n\nI hope you can do some reflecting about your experience with your weight loss program and how you gained weight after you were done with it.            \n\nGiving diet advice for someone who needs to manage diabetes is outside of my expertise,  (maybe check out /r/diabetes or /r/diabetes_t2 or /r/type2diabetes), but I'll give you the general advice. See what resources are an option for you (does your insurance cover any nutritional counseling, for example). The book Glucose Revolution by Jessie Inchauspe is popular.              \n\nEliminate the obvious issues from your diet. Fast food, frequent sweets and snacks, alcohol, fancy coffee drinks, non-diet soda. Depending on your blood sugar needs, figure out a pattern of eating that is sustainable for you (eating every 2 hours, only eating between 8am and 8pm, eating at 4 set times in the day, etc). Focus on mild exercise like a 30 minute walk every day and having protein and vegetables with every meal. When you portion out food for yourself, put it on a plate and put the rest away. Don't eat distractedly. Drink lots of water and get enough sleep. Invest in your emotional health if stress or emotional eating is an issue for you. Find new ways to spend your days if your current patterns lean towards things like eating a snack on the couch while watching tv after the kiddo is asleep (maybe switch it out for a walking pad while watching tv). You can't eat while you knit, for example.           \n\nIf you eat less and move more, you will make progress. You just have to do it.",
          "Don't stress about the number, just focus on being the healthiest you can be during that time frame. 1200-1600 calories per day will be a healthy goal. Track everything through an app or food diary, and try to focus on nutritious foods like green veggies and lean protein. Exercise at least 30 minutes 3x per week, with a mix of cardio and strength training. Even better, find social forms of exercise you can do with friends -- running, dancing, hikes, sports, etc. \n\nYou probably look better than you realize right now. Do these things and pounds will melt away, especially at your age. Please have at least one cheat meal with friends per week and please don't ignore the social element right now. You're only in high school once. \n\nBe kind to yourself, and if you start a routine now it will be much easier to carry you through your later years. You look better than you know now. You may not hit the exact number you want by graduation, but you will look and feel great.\n\nIf you keep it up, you will hit that number (if it's a healthy weight for your body) before you start university. \n\nI hope you are healthy and happy for years to come.",
          "First of all, really sorry to hear that man. It is a total kick in the nuts when you’ve made so much awesome progress only to hear that you have a health concern that you weren’t aware of and probably thought if anything you were preventing it by losing so much weight.\n\nBut still, good on you. If you hadn’t lost the weight, your situation would only be worse than it is.\n\nReally, diet is where the weight loss happens anyways. Exercise can definitely help, but it’s absolutely a game of calories in versus the amount of calories your body use the day for energy. And as long as you’re in a deficit, you’ll lose weight.\n\nI would recommend if you’re not already familiar with how calories and counting calories works to watch some YouTube videos on that. Also, I think fasting is a fantastic idea. One method that’s pretty popular is called. Intermittent fasting. I typically use it most days and I’ve had a lot of really good success in losing weight with it.\n\nThe basic gist of it is that you only eat in a certain window of time, a really popular one is noon to 8 PM and then you don’t eat anything from 8 PM until noon the next day.\n\nYou can have stuff like black coffee And really anything that’s kind of under 20 cal shouldn’t be any problems but don’t like stack up multiples of 20 cal just keep it under 20 cal total and you’ll be fine.\n\nIt’s really good system because you can only eat so many calories in eight hours, so just buy that sure fact alone you’re very likely to eat less calories than you otherwise would.\n\nI’m not a doctor, so don’t take this as medical advice but if I was in your shoes, I would definitely figure out about how many calories you’re burning per day and then make sure to eat a deficit of that, I’m not sure what a good deficit would be but this is where you probably wanna talk to your doctor or nutritionist or as a last resort watching YouTube videos of people who are in your shoes as far as weight range and get some insights from them.\n\nI don’t know you, b",
          "Okay. So I would start by not cutting any calories from what you’re eating right now. Just go ahead and track all your calories from what you’re in taking currently. Then, I would just cut about 250 calories from that and see if it helps drop some weight. Also, don’t shy away from eating carbs. Your brain and body need it for energy. I would implement a slow and long walk daily, and see if you can start tracking your steps. I started by taking 10k steps daily, and I noticed my weight come off. Also, I would change your macros to more protein, veggies, and eat whatever leftover in carbs. If you ever feel the need for something sweet, eat fruits. I eat the frozen ones from the market. It’s usually like 80 calories for 140 grams of so m, so it’s super low calories and so you can eat tons of it. Then if you’re fine with this, after a little, go into the gym and lift weights. I know females in my gym right now that eat like 2700 calories and just lifts. They all say the same thing. They started lifting weights so they can eat whatever they want. Just start with light weights and do tons of reps. Good luck!",

Then, take it one day at a time. Truly.\n\nI lost 75 lbs this year after a lifetime of struggle. Key for me was realizing that consistency is the most important thing. The only thing, really. As such, you need to pick something you can do day in and day out for months and then maintain for years. For me, this meant finally abandoning the idea of a “perfect diet” that eliminated major food groups or made me miserable. For instance, I really hate chicken. I cannot do a diet where I eat nothing but chicken breasts for the rest of my life.",
          "I have lost that weight quite easily in that time. But I was a big dude. And the more weight you have, the faster it is to lose.\n\nIt's about being consistent, not cheating, maintaining discipline and focus. Thats it. Weight loss is mostly diet related. Exercise does help, but not as much as people think. How to ignore hunger pains? you just ignore it. And everyday you succeed in not giving in is another day of resistance built up to eventually you can ignore a massive box of free doughnuts if it was put infront of you. Of course, if you can throw out every unhealthy thing in your house. That helps. Also if you are an habitual eater or bored eater, putting your focus elsewhere such as education can help.\n\nHow many Calories is kinda irrelevant, my answer is not going to be the same as someone elses because we all come in different shapes and sizes and what is a caloric intake for someone who is 7ft and 500lbs is going to be very different to someone who is 5ft and 200lbs in achieving weightloss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGetting a gym membership however is fantastic.

          "The first two weeks are the hardest. Tell yourself you will do it strict for two weeks and after that if you want to quit you can. But you won’t want to. I had to be so strict with myself in the beginning. Track your calorie intake, make sure you’re doing lots of cardio, don’t keep any junk food in the house. At the gym, in the beginning make sure majority of your workout is cardio. Skip the elliptical and go straight to the stairclimber. The weight will melt off. For food, find a breakfast, lunch, dinner recipe that fit your calorie budget, and eat them over and over and over until you’re sick of it. If you like to eat large volumes, tell yourself you will eat the proper portion, put it away, and after later if you still want more, you can. Most of the time you’ll find you don’t have that crazy craving anymore. Once you get a routine set and you’re over that initial shock, don’t be so hard on yourself. Slipping up is inevitable and if you can work with it, things will be so much easier. Extra hungry one day, then eat more, but still make every day count and be mindful of when you feel like you can push yourself harder or maybe eat less. My biggest piece of advice would be to recognize your bad habits and work with them. For example I like to snack at night, so I always will save some calories for bed time. I still enjoy my night snack so for now it’s staying. I could go on and on, as I have done what you just described, but stick through the beginning and I promise it gets easier. I don’t feel out of control anymore. I hope all of this makes sense and something resonates with you.

I really and truly believe you are setting yourself up for failure and disappointment. And I don't want that for you.\n- You've struggled to lose weight *for years*\n- Losing weight faster is *harder* than losing weight slow\n- Fast weightloss comes with all sorts of negatives; you are more likely to have loose skin, more likely to lose strength and muscle mass instead of fat, are more likely to regain the weight and are at greater risk of becoming malnourished.\n\nIt's a little different for people who are morbidly obese...but it sounds like that's not you \n\nHowever you decide to do it, I hope it works out.

          "I was in a very similar situation as you and I have *drastically* improved myself over the last few months. I was approaching 300 pounds and decided to take control of the situation. I’ve lost over 50 pounds in the four months since, and I’m still working on it. \n\nSome strategies/ things that have been really helpful:\n1. Start tracking your calories immediately. Use an app. I use MyFitnessPal (it’s free). It will blow your mind how many pointless, stupid calories you’re consuming. Get those bad habits out into the daylight ASAP.\n1. Once you’re in the habit of counting calories, find out how many calories you need to sustain your current weight with a completely sedentary lifestyle. Set a calorie budget of 500 calories less than whatever that number is. In my case, I started out at something like 2,450 for maintenance, so that made my daily limit 1,950 to start.\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/calorie-calculator/itt-20402304\n1. As you lose weight (and you will start losing quickly if you stick to your budget), recalculate that that maintenance and undercut it again by 500 each time you recalculate. I’m currently at 2,200 maintenance, so my daily limit is 1,700. Keep moving the goal posts. \n\nThis is the main rule set for the game. It really comes down to eating less than your body needs (known as “CICO”—calories in, calories out—around this sub). Easy to say. Hard to do. Those first couple of weeks when your body is used to so much more food, sugary drinks, etc. are *brutal*. So many cravings. If you can fight through it, it gets much easier after that. \n\nOther things I use that really help:\n1. Intermittent fasting. I use 8 hours on, 16 hours off. My brain now understands that during those 16 hours, food is not an option (excepting coffee and alcohol). \n1. Eliminate all liquid calories, particularly the sugary drinks that are loaded with carbs. The only liquid calories I consume come from alcohol. \n1. Keto-friendly bread product",
          "40 pounds in five months is ... doable. It will take dedication, and will get harder as you get closer to your goal weight. 8 pounds a month is 2 pounds a week, which is on the high side for the recommended healthy speed of weight loss (1 to 2 pounds a week), but is achievable.\n\nMost of weight loss is really in your diet. Eat smaller portions, is the bottom line. Choose healthy options.\n\nWorking out will help with your mental health, plus will help your resolve: when you realize you've worked out for an hour and only burned 150 to 200 calories, you'll really understand why controlling the intake is probably more important than controlling the calories burned!\n\nThe thing is, weight loss is unpredictable, especially for women. When we ovulate, our bodies hold on to weight like they're preparing for a famine. A week or so later, our bodies will happily let go of some of that stored weight in a big whoosh. \n\nSo prepare yourself mentally that some weeks will be slow - you'll lose no weight or may even gain a pound. Don't give up, keep your eyes on the ball, continue to make healthy food choices, keep exercising.\n\nThe good news is, if you stay focused, you'll be a heck of a lot closer to goal by your birthday. Maybe you do lose 40 pounds - yay! Maybe you lose only 25 pounds rather than the 40 you'd wanted to lose. It's still a heck of a lot better than being 40 pounds overweight, right? You'll only be 15 pounds overweight by then. \n\nOn the other hand, if you don't start, or if you start and then get discouraged during one of those weeks where you don't lose weight? You'll be depressed when your birthday comes around and you realize you didn't make those changes.\n\nIt's all up to you. You make the choices. If you decide you're going to lose the weight, you'll get started today. You don't need a food scale or the best workout gear. You can start by simply eating less than you ate yesterday, drinking more water, and going for a walk. Do just that little bit, and you'll litera",
          "it is never too late friend!! i saw a an over 50 pound gain over the course of my relationship, and then a near 20 lb one right after i got married. It felt so discouraging, being in such a happy period of my life, and having to take my pretty wedding shoes off because my ankles weren't strong enough to hold my weight up.\n\ni cannot imagine how difficult it is to be constantly reminded that you are the weight you are, and that that is what people see *first,* see *most* about you. i am in full belief that you have hobbies, that you are a joy to talk to, that you contribute merit and encouragement to conversations you are in. you are *more* than a number on a scale.\n\nmy first bit of advice would be to log your calories, eating normally, for a week. don't put in a goal on MyFitnessPal, just log your calories. That staunch reality of you likely taking in 2500+ calories a day - use that to ground yourself, to commit yourself; NOT to condemn yourself. Be realistic first, take action after.\n\nI also have a sedentary lifestyle. I'm an accountant in the midst of tax season - i am at work a minimum 10 hours a day from 7 to 5, eating lunch at my desk. I have used this to my advantage - if i don't take that much food to work, i don't overeat. I pre-log my lunch calories while I'm eating breakfast, so i know exactly how much room i have to eat in the evenings. some nights i have only had enough calories left over to eat some sugar free jello and a protein bar - and i felt fine. i felt fine! you can so do this.\n\n[https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) is a great calorie deficit calculator to figure out how much you need to eat in a day to lose weight. from what you have shared here, it looks like making a goal of consuming no more than 1900 calories a day would help you lose up to 1 lb a week. \n\nlosing weight is a marathon, not a sprint. if you kept up, that 1 lb a week would turn into 4 lbs a month, 24 lbs in 6 mont",
          "The first thing I would do is get in to see the dietician and your primary care physician. Get your bloodwork done. See where you’re at and where you can be realistically by the end of this year. They will help you determine what your diet and calorie intake should look like. \n\nAfter that, get MOVING. You can start slow. I’ve been walking 3/4 times a week, about 60-90min per session for three months. I have had success in losing fat with this exercise regimen and a calorie deficit. \n\nIf you don’t have trackers already, get them. Holding yourself accountable to staying consistent is the only way you’ll see change. Apple Watch, FitBit, whatever, track your steps/exercise. Use calorie counting apps like LoseIt! app or MyFitnessPal. Both apps have reddit subs you can join for advice and community similar to this one. Lastly, USE A FOOD SCALE! Eyeballing will set you way further back than you realize. \n\nI am also 26F, I know how daunting weight loss can seem looking forward from your starting point. But we are SO young and change is ABSOLUTELY possible!!!",
          "Lost 300 pounds over three years, have been in maintenance mode for about a year. Like you, I started exercising towards the end (like last 25 percent of the weight i lost or about that). I think that was when I just went from “losing weight” to actively changing myself into a different person who values staying in shape and being healthy. I was losing weight in a healthy way before that, but starting to regularly exercise gave me a ton of energy and confidence and completely made me feel like a new person. \n\nI think the biggest part of that was starting strength training. Muscle mass is super important for staying healthy and it actually burns more calories than fat and thus slightly increases your metabolism. Also its just makes you feel healthy and able and energized like I said. I highly recommend starting strength training, even if it’s just something basic. I would look into the r/fitness wiki if your are interested,  its an amazing resource, and has a lot of tools for beginners:\n\nhttps://thefitness.wiki/guided-tour/\n\nPersonally i just picked a beginner dumbell routine from that wiki, and pretty quickly transitioned to a free weight routine and have been slowly adding complexity from there. Its pretty much just part of my life now.",
          "CICO. \n\nJust start logging everything you eat in an app (I use My Fitness Pal). Don’t even worry about restrictions at first, just start paying attention to how much you consume and you’ll naturally start making some better decisions about high calorie foods. \n\nOnce you start feeling the pounds come off and you start to get a sense of where your real calorie bombs are, you will learn what you need to restrict more diligently. For me it was cutting sugary drinks (coke) and less starch at dinner time (smaller portions of pasta/rice/potatoes and bread). It might look different for you (maybe your weakness is ice cream, or potato chips). \n\nAdding some daily exercise can help a little but this is secondary to smarter eating.\n\nDon’t be afraid of going slow. It leads to more sustainable healthy weight.\n\nI’m down 65lbs doing these things over three years.",
          "Correct me if I’m wrong, but it looks like you’ve only been doing this for a week? Women really need to do it consistently for a month before you can judge how well it’s working. You might even have to wait like 8 weeks if you’re adding new exercise to your routine.\n\nOur cycles just cause too much weight fluctuation to judge after only a week. A new exercise program will cause you to retain water too.\n\nIt also sounds like you might be making this too complicated. If I were you, I’d just keep up with the exercise and eat somewhere between 1500 and 2000 calories a day. Keep up the good work weighing and measuring your portions!\n\nI’d also probably aim to eat 100 to 125g of protein per day. But not because protein has any magical weight loss properties. It just helps manage appetite while dieting.\n\nTry to be less emotional and more logical about the process if you can. If you stay in a significant calorie deficit for a few months you WILL lose weight. Just trust the process.",
          "The first week or two, tracking is the goal. I went over calorie a bunch my first week because I didn't know what I was eating, but you still need supper. Take the first week or so as educational and don't stress if you realize your afternoon nacho plate took you over your daily goal, then have your usual dinner but track it. Then you have information to start with.\n\nNormalize your eating patterns. 3 meals, 2 snacks (which can be veggies, an apple and/or a little protein depending on your restrictions). Don't starve all day because that way lies madness and binging.\n\nTry very, very hard to divorce emotion from weight loss. It's just numbers, you are still you no matter your weight.",
          "That sucks. But… it is actually nice that people are willing to say something to you about it. To me that means that you must actually be well liked.\n\nDieting can be hard. But all diets have some merit. Generally when i have been at my highest weights i have done well doing IF, keto or using a fancy scale that tells me the calories to maintain my weight(just eat less than that number every day) \nOr change 1 thing each week. If it is a hard change spend more than one week on it. For example.. no candy/no man made sugar, no soda/only water(get drink drops for flavor, no gluten, park your car far from the bldg, take stairs, eat within 8 hrs/stop by 6p. \nThere a lot of healthy habits that are not a total diet that can ease you in.\nExercise… doesnt have to be a big deal. I did really well with a weighted hula hoop. At first 30 seconds had me huffing and puffing then i could do it for hours. Make sure hula to your right and left for muscle balance. Then i started doing kettle bell swinging at home. I never hot fancy with that but i did get really strong and good at the basics. Swings can be done in the hundreds in like 2 minutes. You dont have to spend hours working out if you are using weights but you do have to be safe. Get help or watch a lot of videos!!! I started at 15/20lbs for kettle bells and ended up on 65lbs. My husband has trouble moving that bell. Then there is hiking which is a terrible sounding word. It is just walking outside and ideally up hill. If you walk miles…you are moving and burning…check yourself with a fitness watch/app on steps. For abs….real push ups with proper form. You can start with a plank or doing them on the kitchen counter and then a bench and then the floor. Maybe 5 at a time…it is ok if it is hard and puny if it is good form. One day you can do a hundred and this is where actual full core strength and a nice tummy come from.\nIF is an amazing way to lose weight but it will crap your metabolism out ultimately so if you do it phase i to i",
          "Make a small change everyday. Don't try to go hardcore and cut everything from Day 1. You don't have to diet, just be mindful of what you eat and drink. Try drinking more water instead of sugary juices and sodas (you can even try flavored sparkling waters with zero sugar as a start). Substitute snacks for healthier snacks (chips/chocolates/cake etc for fruits, veggies, nuts, crackers, healthier snack bars etc). There is a big difference in terms of 1,000 calories of broccoli and say 1,000 calories of ice cream. And don't try to do too much exercise or high intensity workouts from the start. Try going for a short walk everyday, if its cold, just start from 5 mins and then increase it a bit everyday as it gets warmer out. Eating healthier will not only make you look good, but it will make you FEEL good, so focus on how it makes you feel! And do not discourage or beat yourself up from others judgements. Life is challenging and its a struggle, but there are better and more effective ways to manage stress/depression than using food as comfort. It does not hurt to try a prescription medication for depression if you need it for the meantime, you can also try a therapist, or try getting a hobby (something that you enjoy) that helps in relaxation. I picked up on doing diamond paintings and they really relax me and help a lot, and you can just do them a little bit everyday, you could also try scratch art, its pretty fun, just anything to help relax. If you live near a Hobby Lobby, its a good place to start! All the best on your journey, you will get there soon enough, keep your head up, and don't give up, you can do it :)",

          "Hey OP\n\nNot a nutritionist, but these are some points I though. \n- if you’re unable to sustainably diet, increase your calorie intake to 1500 or 1600(a small deficit basically) and slowly work your way downwards. \n- eat more meals throughout the day: instead of three big meals, have 5 or 6 smaller meals \n- add in foods that have less calories but make you full faster. veggies are fantastic for this\n- Have protein: Incorporate protein into all your meals- eggs are a fantastic way\n- have natural sugars for your cravings : apples, bananas etc \n- once you have lost some weight, and you start increasing your deficit, slowly build in exercise. \n\nLastly, don’t worry about what the scale says. You had a vacation, you had a good time. The thing to note here is to get back to your schedule and eat clean, eat well and enjoy the journey.

          "One of the best things you can do for your health right now is increase your water, fiber, and protein intake. Yes, of course losing weight is going to help, but I promise you your brain is going to like adding much more than subtracting. I struggle too with falling off the wagon at the same point in the day. The days I’m most successful, I:\n\n1) intermittent fast until about 2-3pm (WARNING: do not do this unless you have your next meal PLANNED AND READY because you WILL binge). I drink an energy drink in the morning (not recommended), but caffeine and carbonation does help me get through the first half of the day without eating. \n\n2) my first meal is a protein shake with protein powder, water, Greek yogurt, chia seeds, flax seeds, strawberries, and zero sugar protein powder (edit: sorry not protein powder, zero sugar cheesecake pudding mix). It’s a ton of protein and a good amount of fiber. I may start subbing the water for 80 calorie non fat fairlife milk for more protein. \n\n3) this holds me off for a couple hours. I’ll then have a fruit and some jerky. Like an apple or something. Key here is I DO NOT MAKE IT A MEAL OR SIT DOWN. Once I sit down it’s over. I try to plan all my chores or work or running around with this snack because this is when I start to have problems. If I’m busy, I’m not too food crazy. \n\n4) I have a large dinner LATE. Like right before I’m going to go to bed. And very high protein. Last night I had like a 1100 calorie dinner, but it was 5.5oz chicken, 3oz linguini, and a protein alfredo sauce that is very easy to make (blend cottage cheese, low fat cream cheese, non fat fairlife milk, garlic, fresh Parmesan, salt, and pepper, and warm). It was delicious and a ton of protein. I ended up at 1329 calories yesterday and 119g protein. \n\n5) sometimes (like last night), I put half of my dinner in a Tupperware immediately and eat it an hour or two after dinner. It gives me something to look forward to (I think I just like the actual act of eating). \n\n6",
          "I went to a weight loss clinic covered by my insurance and I see a dietician there as well. Mine gave me macros, how much water to drink, how much to exercise.

I try to stay below 160 grams of carbs and focus alot on protein, atleast 130g a day, also I consume 1600 calories usually. I'm only down 40 lbs but it felt impossible at first so we take what we get and we keep on moving! Starting a routine is the best way to stay consistent. Hope I helped :)",

All my carbs were natural like from sweet potatoes or from fruits. I cut out breads and pasta. \nIntermittent fasting is helpful too. At your weight you could easily drop a large number of pounds in a reasonable amount of time. \nTry to completely cut out all carbonated/sweetened drinks and all processes food.

          "This was my starting weight last year. Ive been doing intermittent fasting for 8 months and ive lost 40lbs. If you try it, the fasting reddit had a lot of information and i reccomend doing a lot of research first. Beyond that, try to be aware of whats going on. Go to the doctor. Look at the calories of things you eat and try to note it, and if you discover youve overeaten, then dont judge yourself. Just try to notice and try again tomorrow. Whatever works for you, its better to lose the weight slowly and keep it off than run off on a diet you cant sustain. Little habit changes count. Black coffee or tea, finding reasons to walk further instead of the quickest route, making it special when you eat out, but not often. You've got this!",
          "First of all, congrats! Facing the problem is the 1st step!\n\nKeep a positive attitude, realize every day won't be (and doesn't need to be) perfect and be kind to yourself along the way. Your still a person who deserves love and respect, at a minimum from yourself. \n\nBest advice I can give you is baby steps. At first I'd just try to start reconciling everything you eat and drink until you do that reliably. Get a picture of what your consuming, and how much of it. Then start to dig in to the nutritional end a bit, at the surface level. How many carbs, fats and proteins. How many calories. How much of your intake is solid foods vs liquids/drinks. \n\nThen once you understand your intake, maybe try shifting towards a calorie deficit. It doesn't even need to be massive right away. So many of these \"biggest loser\" or \"my 600 pound life\" diets revolve around 1000 calorie or less diets. At your weight, your very likely at a TDEE well over 4000 calories and with some light walking... probably as much as 4500 calories a day just to maintain that 560 pounds. So even if you dropped to 2000 a day or 2500 a day, that has you in a place where you could be losing nearly 5 pounds a week.\n\nGet creative with your calories at this point. You can still eat really good by making some targeted decisions. Lean proteins. Veggies. Berries. Pickles. Low sugar / zero sugar stuff. Low sugar / zero sugar sauces, spices, salad dressings.  \n\nI started at 340 pounds last August and I am now down to 245 pounds. I feel on average deprived of nothing. I still have pizza. Just two slices, not the entire thing like before. I still have ice cream. Just the carb smart ice cream. I still eat BBQ sauce, ketcup, etc.... again just low/no sugar. I eat two to three fairly big meals a day. I'm often usually not hungry. I've learned to cook, and embrace cooking and using my spices and seasonings to make the food taste great. That helps a lot. \n\nThe majority of your weight loss will come through nutritional",
          "Trying to get fast results immediately is not necessarily the mindset. You want to make permanent changes in a sustainable way. You want to change things for the rest of your life. So if it takes a year or two of gradual change to get there, that’s what you need to do. \n\nYou will probably have to learn to accept that your family will nag you to eat more food. Say no. Keep saying no. Eat less anyways. \n\nWalk the half hour to work. That’s not an unrealistic distance- actually an hour of walking would be a great amount of exercise for your health each day. If you can’t do it yet, then think about starting it in 6 months after you lost some weight.\n\nMake sure you’re eating enough protein and fiber/complex carbs to satiate and energize you through the day. Personally, that fog of fatigue and ‘food noise’ (the impulse/craving to eat even though your body doesn’t need any more food yet) I find for me most often comes from when I’ve been eating a lot of carbs without protein or fat, especially refined/simple carbs with low fibre. Adding a little bit of meat to every meal has really helped me to not feel fatigued while losing weight. \n\nThe thing that actually finally made the real difference, for me and most in this sub, was counting calories. For some people it gets them feeling bad/guilty about food, but I actually found the opposite. It let me make deliberate decisions about eating treats, without feeling guilt.",
          "Worry not! Repeated small attempts can turn into consistent changes and regular habits. I fail at like everything I do and I just keep trying until it works, I can \"try\" something 5x until it even \"starts\". Do the same; be constantly willing.\n\nI've lost 22lbs in the past 3 months and I've barely gotten out of the house. I started a bigger attempt at weight loss at 282lbs in November. I'm now 259 and I've barely done anything. I started calorie counting a week ago.\n\nSome of the best advice I got was that if you stick to 10 healthy foods that you like you will see a change - and they do get welcomingly boring. You mentioned take-away and it is notorious for being calorie dense. Other advice was to just have 1-low cal and 1-high cal meal and that's been working for me. I snack after dinner. I skip breakfast and eat at 2pm & 6pm, pushing off the first meal so that after dinner I'm still -1250 calories and I can then snack on whatever I want while minding not going past -500. For mindless snacking salted popcorn is super ideal. I'm rarely hungry. I'm not strict either. Sometimes I eat at 11am, lunch at 1pm, dinner at 4pm, etc. Sometimes I get to within 100 cal of maintenance. Last week I ate like 6500cal during a sushi lunch.\n\nFeeling discouraged doesn't quite lead to weight loss, it only suggests that you lose weight. Being discouraged leads to weight gain IMO. You want to instead see yourself making healthy choices but then be \"happy\" about doing those things and it will further your better direction, it's the only way to remain consistent. If you continually berated yourself you'll make bad choices so be happy now, in that you're even recognizing this. Positive reinforcement all the way!\n\nMy \"10 foods list\" has: smoked sardines, yogurt, bananas, pork rinds, eggs, bacon, avocado, lunch meat, pickles, beef, pork, sausage, hamburger, salad (that's like 15 things??).

          "I have recently lost about 32 pounds.  The best thing to do is to see a good nutritionist and don't fall for fad diets.  Focus on eating healthy food that will fill you up.  Complex carbs, like potatoes, are OK in moderation. A nutritionist can help you figure out what you need to eat during the day.  It is always possible to eat whatever you want occasionally.  A good eating plan is to fill half your plate with vegetables, eat a starch and lots of protein.  This will keep you satiated.  Exercise, especially strength training, is helpful for building muscle.  The one thing you have going in your favor is that you are young and male, primed for muscle building and that is really going to be your friend. Drink lots of water.  Can you lose 50 pounds before summer?  That's an ambitious goal.  I think 30 is more reasonable, especially if you're gaining muscle mass.  You will look slimmer and feel better, though.  Anything above that will be your bonus weight loss.\n\nBaked chips are a good alternative to regular chips, but chips are not nutritious and should not be a routine part of your day.  You would be better off snacking on a baked potato with non-fat sour cream. Snacks -- fruit, vegetables and hummus, smoothie if not loaded with sugar, nuts- but only a quarter cup at a time.

Still, going to an Al-Anon meeting and talking to folks with relatives who are addicts might help you find strategies for helping your father.\n\nI think it's important to bear in mind that losing 70-ish pounds in your 60s is pretty painful. If you don't have a lot to live for, and you take away the one thing that makes life bearable...  Usually, obese people start seeing some incredibly painful and terrifying symptoms before they hit 60, and, frequently that glimpse into the pain to come tends to be enough motivation to endure the pain of deprivation, but, it sounds like your father might have escaped that torture so far- maybe because he isn't that horribly obese, or because he was active at some point, maybe because he lifted weights earlier in his life- or had a job that involved lifting- or perhaps he's just got exceptionally good genes. However he's escaped the curse, as you well know, his luck is about to run out.\n\nBottom line, though, you're asking him to endure a LOT of pain- less pain than if he continues unabated, but, still a lot of pain. At the end of the day, the ability to endure this kind of misery can't come from someone else. The addict has to choose that path themselves.  Interventions can be effective, but it sounds like you've already done the equivalent of a intervention by telling him that you don't want to see him die.\n\nOne thing you can do to help your father is to, if you haven't already, get your act together.  You shouldn't be going anywhere near processed foods- of any kind.  And your BMI can't be a spec above the middle of normal- unless you're jacked.  If he sees you displaying discipline, it might help him when the time comes.  The good (and bad) news is that the time will come.

He knows what's healthy, but he just doesn't seem motivated to eat it. He's now on a few statins to help with his blood pressure. \n\nI've tried everything over the years to help him. \n\n- I had a pact where I would commit to eat healthy if he would too (he would always break first). \n\n- I tried a online betting site where I'd lose money if he didn't lose weight (he didn't care, and let me lose the money).\n\n- I told him how much it would hurt me to see him die, and it makes him feel bad, but then he'll keep eating. \n\n- I told him to get in ozempic, and he said he doesn't trust it, it's poison (right after eating a hot dog and a chicken bake). \n\nI think his issues are that he gets bored, and he has absolutely zero impulse control. Worst of all- he doesn't seem to really value his own life, since he's getting old and figures \"he's gonna die soon anyway\". I know that he'll come to regret his actions when he's about die, but it breaks my heart to see him go down this path and to feel helpless to stop it. I don't wanna give up on him, and want to know if anyone has faced similar struggles with their older parents, and if they found any success with changing their trajectory for the better. \n\n",

Sometimes it comes from a professional it is better received, even when you are saying all the right things. \n\nIt can be really hard to not have your partner value your opinion/ skillset but try to be mindful that weight and eating can be so vulnerable for a lot of people.

Ask him what he thinks, currently in his lifestyle, is going to lead to a 20kg weight loss? Ask him how he expects to lose weight while living the same lifestyle and having the same mindset as the one he had when gaining 20kg? Its gotta feel a bit disrespectful too, at the end of the day, you have the wisdom from your personal experience and success.\n\nEven something like being willingly unaware of how many calories of cheese toppings and oil dressing seems to point to the idea that he doesn't want to be faced with his own behaviour. And is not interested in connecting his daily actions to his long term consequences. It seems he doesn't accept the fact that his actions have consequences. I know, because I used to be the same. I refused to believe that my weekly binge eating was actually causing me a weight gain, because I felt like it wasn't that bad and I took the stairs and not the escalator so it evens out, right?\n\nTLDR; ask him to stop complaining to you about it if he is not going to respect your advice",

          "Going plant based is likely to help your cholesterol if you don't load up on lots of processed treats and coconut. That's a pretty well established correlation. \n\nWeight loss depends. Vegetarians and vegans on average are less overweight than omnivores, but it's not as striking of a correlation as it used to be because there are so many more commercial options. It used to be that you had to learn how to get your protein from beans and tofu, and you pretty much had to eat a lot of vegetables because where else are you gonna get the volume for your meal, and a ton of the unhealthy stuff in the store just wasn't an option because it contained eggs or dairy. Potato chips and spaghetti have always been vegan, but even Oreos (a much cited example of how you can fail a vegan weightloss diet) weren't until the 1990s. If you wanted a treat you had to put time and effort into making a recipe for it. Now, you can buy coconut-based ice cream and Impossible burgers and all kinds of things that are pretty equivalent in nutrition and convenience to the omnivore options.\n\nIn addition, you shouldn't plan to go \"on\" the diet and then \"off\" it. That's how you get results and then lose your results. You'll need to permanently implement some of the things you do during the weight-loss phase. It wouldn't be a bad idea to go fully plant-based, if you're feeling like trying it out, *as a learning phase*. But if/when you want to reintroduce animal products, do it mindfully with an eye to keeping the best habits you developed - not just \"letting things slide\" back to how they were before.

In order to lose weight AND maintain it, your diet has to be sustainable to your lifestyle and ability to be disciplined to keep up with it (for the most part). If you are not a big meat eater to begin with, a primarily plant-based diet might be suitable for you. \n\nWhatever you eat, be aware of your calorie consumption, as certain plant foods (like nuts or avocado and especially store/processed ones) has a bit of calories. Oils have a high amount of calories in just 1 tablespoon, so be aware of this when you use it for cooking/sauces/dressings. Calorie monitoring doesn't have to be tedious. Most people don't eat different foods each meal, so it's pretty easy to track. Like, you can portion out meals after doing initial calculations and you're set (Ex. I made a lasagna the other day, did all the calculations, divided it by 8 portions, and whenever I eat I slice, I know how much is already in there without stressing).",

You can be a junk food vegan, which many are because their reason for being vegan is more ethical/environmental than health related, or you can do CICO on a balanced vegan diet. It’s just like being a meat eater, CICO is what matters for weight loss. The one thing that does help is that most vegan food is less calorie dense naturally so it’s easier to be a volume eater.",

You absorb 2% of the non heme iron in spinach while absorbing 15-30% of the more easily used heme iron in meat.\n\nEating carbs, like in an apple, just causes water weight to be gained back.

It helped get my blood sugar under control, which in turn did help me lose some weight.  I also ended up spending a good chunk of time planning and prepping meals that I actually wanted to eat because I'm a bit picky. It ended up being more of a time investment than I could reasonably deal with(this is personal tolerance).\n\nThrough trial and error, I realized that eliminating processed foods and learning what appropriate portions looked like was more effective at controlling my caloric intake than cutting out meat and dairy specifically. Going plant based also helped me introduce a wider number of plant foods to my diet I didn't eat before, like lentils. Eventually, I went back to eating meat, but it's generally very lean cuts in small amounts and mixed with plant protein sources. I still mostly eliminate dairy except for a small amount of plain yogurt. \n\nI'm down 70 lbs, and most of the progress came when I started weight training.  I will say I have the caveat of being a 5' tall woman, so weight training has been integral in maintaining my muscle mass and keeping my calorie burn up. That may not be a factor for you.",

If your insulin levels are continually high, then you're going to be hungry (hangry, really) all the time. Especially true with insulin resistance,  which is very common, and those of us who have it are at a greater risk of developing diabetes if it goes unmanaged. Insulin resistance is easy to manage with food and exercise.  The blood work is interesting for this one. You go in a fasted state and then you drink a couple of drinks loaded with sugar (yuck, I don't like sugary anything) and then you go back to get blood drawn after a couple of hrs of drinking the sugary drinks. Anyway, I finally tried Metformin this year and I too don't have food in my mind as constant and it does seem to mellow out your brain. It's said that it manages the insulin levels in your brain,  so guess is that  you're more calm when you're taking it. BTW, what dose are you taking? Any side effects? :)",

Taking a 10 min Walk after meals has a faster and more drastic effect than metformin. So if you're not gonna exercise, metformin is the magic pill that will make it easier to lose weight.

If you continue to regard how you ate before as \"normal\" and go back to it, then you will regain the weight. \n\nThe process of losing weight should be helping you learn what \"normal\" is actually supposed to be, and helping you get into the habit of eating that way permanently.

I struggle with my appetite/cravings, but I have noticed a decrease in my appetite (without making me feel sick or like I'm starving). I also feel full and satisfied faster, so I'm not overeating and I have no desire to binge either. I'm not craving carbs as intensely, so it makes it easier to make healthier food choices (a salad over a slice of pizza, for example).

          "I'm on Meformin (extended release) since February 2019. I knew I had PCOS since my puberty, and 25 years ago gynecologists where I live didn't know much about insulin resistance which usually (not always) accompanies PCOS. So I struggled with my weight, my periods, mood swings, and I thought that is how things should be. I couldn't take any of my weight off before Metformin because I was always so hungry. That hunger is hard to explain to someone who never felt it: I felt it whole day, from the moment I open my eyes till moment I fall asleep. If I didn't eat something, anything, in moments of hunger, I was getting so angry that I was unbearable person to be around. \n\nSince I started Metformin I could started to change my diet for better (smaller portions for start, which was revelation for me since till that moment I didn't realise how big my portion sizes were due constant hunger and for eating). I feel so much better now, my weight slowly goes down, my periods are regular, my hunger is gone. I don't have any particular problem with Metformin, but I use supplementation (Metformin is linked with B12 deficiency). I feel so much better and like new person that I am afraid to ever go from it, afraid that hunger will come back.\n\nEdit: my dad has similar isuess with hunger like me. I thought that my hunger started in puberty with offset of PCOS symptoms, but eye opener was when my mum said (after I was on medication for one year): \"You are not so hungry anymore and is so strange. Since you were child you were always hungry and angry just like your dad, so I always struggled to make meals as soon as possible to fed both of you.\"",
          "Start with 500 mg of Metformin RX once a day, preferably with your evening meal for a week or two until your body gets used to it, then increase your dosage to 2x a day with ur meals and stay on this for a couple weeks or more until you feel like your body is used to it. You can then increase to 750mg 2X a day. The maximum my doctor advises is 1000 mg 2x a day.",
          "Metformin is a weight neutral medication. It won’t cause weight gain nor weight loss on its own. What it does do is make your skeletal muscles more sensitive to the insulin you are producing (reducing insulin resistance). This helps shift the glucose in your blood into your muscle cells where you can use it as energy. It won’t cause a hypo on its own (it won’t make you release more insulin) so it’s a very safe medication. Issues however include gut upsets. Not everyone gets this, and if you do, try to persist as it goes away for many. Some people however cannot tolerate metformin. \nOne other thing you need to be aware of is that it stimulates your ovaries and can make it easier for you to get pregnant - so make sure you’re taking contraception if that’s not what you’re after and you’re sexually active. \nIf you make changes in your diet and increase your physical activity, you can lose weight on metformin.",
          "Omg. I’ve been trying to explain this to folks. I can eat an entire meal, and in my mind I should be full, but I was always starving. My doctor suggests -glutide medications, but my insurance doesn’t cover “obesity preventative medications”- and I just can’t afford them out of pocket. My doc said they would cover Metformin and it was worth a try. This is the first time in a long time where I’m not starving the whole day, which makes me much nicer. I can sleep through the night instead of waking up because I need to eat. It’s been amazing. I’m definitely nauseous but I’m hoping that will subside a bit.",
          "I started metformin a few weeks ago and it’s doing exactly what I needed it to. The stories online scared me so much I was afraid to start it. It’s been AMAZING! I was previously in Mounjaro for 8 months and lost 55 pounds of that. Then I tried contrave. It did absolutely nothing. Metformin is doing exactly what I need. It’s controlling my cravings so I am able to be in a canoe deficit without  much effort. I’m not sick on it at all!!! I’ve lost about 6 pounds since starting. The medicine won’t make you automatically lose weight but it takes away the cravings so you can still to a plan. I’m very happy with it.",
          "Metformin. I’m seriously insulin resistant, and metformin puts me on an even playing field with other people whose endocrine system works normally.",
          "Since you’re just starting it’s likely a bit of both! it sounds like you’re actually eating less and since you just started it’s likely a little bit water weight as well. As long as you keep up eating sensibly you can keep the weight off. If you find your hunger increasing you can also add physical activity which allows you more flexibility with calorie intake. I’d also start tracking generally how many calories you are eating and look up your tdee and find a range that feels sustainable without the metformin.",
          "I was put on metformin for pre-diabetes and it only lasted a week or so. I was nauseous every day and then one day I ended up puking my guts out at around 3a and calling off work. My mom was on it for years and said once you get past the first two weeks or so it gets better but I didn't want to go through those two weeks of torture.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm so glad it's working for you!",

Hey all— kind of hypothetical here, but i’m looking to lose about 20-40 pounds for health and aesthetic reasons. curious if people had unlimited money how they would go about losing weight?\n\ni struggle with meal prep so maybe a delivery service? or personal chef to come? would a nutritionist help? a certified dietician? \n\ni think for point of this post i’d rule out taking ozempic\n\nalso just to be clear— i don’t have unlimited funds, but im just trying to problem solve creatively \n\nmy general pain point is that i have a demanding job and busy social schedule so eating healthy balanced meals is lower on the list than decompressing after the work day or seeing my loved ones for a meal. i’m not a parent and i strength train like 3-4 times a week (adding in cardio slowly). cw:190, gw:150",

          "It’s very fun and I’d definitely recommend it! I joined a small gym and the classes usually have no more than 8 of us (so it’s not like of of the bigger Gracie Barra gyms), and although there’s only 2 other women that attend, everyone is very supportive and a few of us have joined primarily for weightloss purposes. My buddy and his wife are the ones who got me into it, and have lost over 300lbs between the both of them and started bjj on their journeys.\n\nI only started bjj at the 50lb mark because it was a dangling carrot of mine and by then I was able to budget my monthly $105 membership (…which I’ve heard is a steal, and most people I heard are $125+). Because my gym is small they don’t care what gi you use like other places might which has also been useful while I’ve already bought three of the “Elite Mens Gi” off Amazon since I’ve moved down from a mens A5 to a mens A3. They have womens but the fit wasn’t as comfortable on my current body size, and for ~$60 a gi I just hemmed the pants and jacket sleeves for my shortness. Doing this has made it affordable since the ~$200 I’ve spent on my three would only be one gi most likely at a place that makes you buy their own in house gi.\n\nI also do one class nogi and one class gi. The nogi class is definitely more of a workout class as well (my Apple Watch under the martial arts workout usually gets me between 675~830 active calories for a 2hr class), because it involves the warm ups, learning the drills, and then rolling for the last 30~45 mins of class. My coaches are cool cuz they’ll push me but also understand I may have some more physical limits than others in the class so they’ll also teach me how I can modify some moves and how I can slowly get better at them. I’ll also be honest that in the very beginning I was somewhat embarrassed at being the heaviest one there, but everyone is there to learn and is there for their own reasons…plus at a certain point your weight is somewhat of a tool to “smash and pass” during c",

It sounds like you have an addiction problem and you likely need to see a therapist about it.\n\nThat said I also think you're letting perfect be the enemy of good. I get you view it as a failure since you quit monster/soda cold turkey no problem, but can't quit fast food in the same way, but that's the wrong mindset. Instead of an all or nothing approach, try and slowly reduce how often you get fast food. Start by trying to get it down to once a day, then try and only go 6 days a week, then 5, and so on. This could take months-years, but ultimately slowly weaning yourself off will likely help to make the habit permanent.\n\nYou can also try making better choices when you do get fast food. Pick places with grilled chicken sandwiches or salads, if there are alternative side options besides fries choose that instead, get a smaller sandwich and add lettuce/tomato to it.",
          "I go to Celebrate Recovery at my church. Both of our leaders struggle with food addiction. There are also support groups for this. I highly recommend this type of programs. One of my leaders is in her 60’s. It’s hard for her to walk, she’s diabetic, etc. Her life is hell. Your life has become unmanageable. You need help not shame. PLEASE do CR, you need to see yourself as Jesus sees you. We are here to glorify God and when we have these addictions, we are unable to do that. I hope this helps.",
          "Lets say you're roasting a skin on chicken thigh and sauteing veggies in olive oil and you're having this with sweet potatoes or brown rice. Healthy, right?  Not necessarily. Lower glycemic carbs certainly help, but, for an addict- which you might be, the carbs combined with the fat might still be an issue. Or an apple with peanut butter.  Or almond butter.  This is super unprocessed/healthy, right?  Nope.This isn't really about processed/unprocessed, it's about avoiding combinations of macros that light up our dopamine receptors.\n\nFWIW, guilt really didn't motivate me all that much, but, everyone is different. For decades, I was perfectly fine with the guilt, the shame, the self recrimination.  I was A okay with dying before I hit 60.  But then I got a taste of the pain that obesity related diseases bring- and that *really* motivated me. In a perfect world, we'd all have a crystal ball, be able to see the torture in our future, and use this wisdom to effect change.

          "For me it's been subtracting one from everything I eat. Instead of a whole pizza, leave one piece. Instead of 4 sandwiches at the drive thru, order 3. Even if it's more than somebody *should* eat, it's less than *you were* eating. Eventually you will get used to eating one less and then you subtract another. It's simple, but not always easy. You have to be willing to be very honest with yourself and what you normally eat. I also started at a much higher weight than you're are at, but it's been working for me.\n\nThe other hard part is understanding that you may never *beat* an addiction. At least not in the \"well, done with that\" way you might be thinking of. It's something you have to beat every day. It's a constant choice you have to make, so you find ways to make that choice easier for yourself.",

          "It’s time, really. Your have to get your body and your brain physically used to eating healthy. When your body is 2-3 weeks in to eating clean every single day or even 7 days straight of eating clean it adapts and the cravings for the bad food get replaced for craving what your body is used to, in this case clean food. One thing people don’t really talk about is it’s not easy to eat clean in our modern society, it’s easier to pull up to a drive through window. And after a long day at work or exercise no one feels like taking the time to grill chicken breast, cook rice and cook vegetables, let alone drive to the store and buy it. It’s very hard in the beginning and even feels like your body is craving a drug or withdrawing from a drug but your body is built to adapt and as long as you put in the work day in and day out your cravings for old foods will lessen and you’ll look in the mirror or step on the scale and see that it’s working. And also don’t cold turkey yourself off sugar because you will go in full on sugar withdrawal. You can continue to eat sugar ever day and still lose weight, it just has to be less sugar. So maybe start with ordering that delicious late but pour out half or order a smaller version then what you normally get.",
          "Thank you.  \nTwo years ago if anyone suggested I would be who I am today everyone in the room would have laughed. I would have laughed the loudest. I liked fat jokes then and I still like them now. I was so fat if you cut my leg gravy would have come out.\n\nIt seems like everything worthwhile is hard... When I was living that \"fat lifestyle I was a maniac, half a handle of vodka a day or countless beers. A lot of people have two glasses of wine with dinner, I had two bottles finished by 8:15pm. Of course when I drink I like to snack.

          "I was never addicted to food but I was addicted to heroin and I went to rehab with people that were addicted to food.\n\nI remember one of the guys telling me that the hardest thing about trying to beat food addiction is that you need food to survive.\n\nWith every other drug you just stopped doing it, you don’t need it, but you need food to continue on living.  That’s something I never forgot..\n\nAnyway, here’s my advice;\n1. Get your hormones checked first. Certain hormone imbalances can make you very hungry and trick your brain into thinking that you constantly need to eat. \n1. Stop the strict dieting. This might be controversial but in my opinion when you’re constantly counting calories and thinking about dieting you can’t stop thinking about food and then it just ends up making you more hungry. look at the things that you normally eat and what their calorie intake is so that you have an idea and start to create moderation and balance. \n1. Exercise. People think you need to go to the gym and do some intense work out. No you really don’t. Do you have a dog? Start walking your dog on a daily basis. Start with 1 km and try to work your way up to walking 5 km. Don’t put pressure on yourself and expect that you’re going to do it in the first day, just take it easy and enjoy your walk. \n1. And finally, forgive yourself. Feeling shameful because you binged on some food only makes it worse. You are human, we all have our vices. That McDonalds you ate today isn’t going to end you..tomorrow is a new day;)\n1. On that note I have a 70/30 rule. I eat good 70% of the year and the other 30% is for holidays, cravings, and weak moments lol. \n1. Have a good support net work. That’s honestly what helped me the most. Have a person in your life that you can call your “sponsor”. Anytime you have a weak moment, call that person and tell them. I did the same thing with heroin, and my sponsor talked me off of the edge more than a few times.",

I’ve quit opiates, benzos, nicotine, and alcohol, and your description sounds more like me trying to quit any of the above drugs than when I needed to lose some weight. What you need to do is seek addiction therapy. If you have all of that delivery available in your area, there is probably one who specializes in food addiction.

          "accepting that its an addiction, therapy, etc etc, in practice the biggest thing that helped me was when i started treating the urges and cravings like i did when i quit smoking (note, i do/did not have BED, just a general food addiction, so if the issue is binging idk if this'll work) \n1. acknowledge the feeling \"i am feeling like i want to eat.\" \"i am having a craving for chocolate\", honest and neutral, no \"i need chocolate\" \"i want chocolate\" \"im stupid and want to binge\", this isnt about feeling or needs, its just about shining a light on the actual situation, unbiased so \"i am having a craving for x\" \n1. see if you can add to that statement, no pressure, dont force it, say aloud \"i am having the urge to eat because..\" and see what comes out \"because im stressed\" \"because no one loves me\" \"because thats what i normally do\" etc, if you get a \"because\" you can then try to work on the because so \"i have the urge to eat. i have the urge to eat because im lonely. (focus on the lonely). what solves lonely? call a friend, text, make a post in loseit, visit a discord, watch something that makes you feel less alone (i recommend the IT crowd for this), fix the issue and by fixing it you'll be both distracting yourself from the food urge and solving the actual issue. this can be sensory (esp if youre ND) \" i want to eat because... i need the crunchy/chewy/feeling of swallowing (thats me)/ flavour\" if its one of these you can either mitigate with a \"safer\" method (crunchy can be celery, swallow can be tea, etc you can even make up a chart cause its hard to think in those times) or you can also get chewellery for kids or adults that are food safe, ifs its a flavour sensory thing then boiled sweets in that flavour might help, sented stim toys also exist\n1. you dont get a \"because\" sometimes the reason wont come to us, sometimes there is no reason \"i want to eat because..URGH I JUST WANT IT\" sit down. we know what this is, its a craving or an urge, take three deep breaths,",
          "For me personally, I had to be very counterintuitive and just allow myself all foods without restrictions. I don’t track anything anymore at all, and no foods are “off limits”. \n\nWhen I told myself that, for example, cookies weren’t allowed, all I could do is focus on cookies. Then I would binge on a whole package of cookies and honestly I would hate it. I wouldn’t even WANT to finish the cookies but I HAD TO bc I know I shouldn’t be doing this and it’s bad and I’d beat myself up for it, try not eating for the rest of the day, and then end up binging on my next meal. \n\nNow if I see cookies at the office I think about if it would even taste good or if I actually want it, and if the answer is yes, I’ll take one or even two if I’m REALLY feeling it. But honestly most of the time I don’t want one and carry on with my day and don’t even think about them again. \n\nI also really try to make sure that I eat either a fruit, a vegetable, or both at each meal. Even if I don’t want one in the moment for taste, I want it in the moment for how they make me feel afterwards. It helps fill me up for lower calories as well, so that’s an added bonus. So now if I want pizza, I eat pizza. But 90% of the time I also eat it with a salad or a vegetable. \n\nAnd if I inevitably binge, the biggest thing is I just keep going. I’ll eat my next meal if I’m hungry for it. I constantly break the cycle of what would’ve led me to “failure/falling off the wagon etc.” And just keep going. \n\nSmall progress is still progress. You want sustainable changes. So for instance if you eat take out for dinner every night, planning that you’ll cook every night instead isn’t realistic. So keep getting take out. Either add in a vegetable side, or even just get a smaller portion. If you normally get a double bacon cheeseburger and a large fry, switching to a normal hamburger with a small/medium fry will save you a very significant amount of calories, so you’ll be losing weight, but you won’t feel deprived. \n\nFor me,",

          "Hi there!\nI used to have a severe addiction to junk food, especially Ubereats. I tried everything to quit, including therapy, but nothing worked. The constant “food noise” and obsessive thoughts about food never stopped. \nAfter a real bad health scare in January, I went to see a dietitian. We did a bunch of tests and it turns out that I have a severe intolerance to gluten and the protein found in cow’s milk, which has been causing severe inflammation of the gut and malabsorption of many nutrients for decades, especially iron, vitamin D and magnesium. This makes my body feel like it’s constantly starving, so no matter how much I ate, it would scream for more.\n\nMy gut flora was also completely shot to shit because of the sugar I was eating. It turns out that there are bad bacteria in your intestinal lining that thrive on sugar. The more you eat it, the more it grows, making you constantly crave and think about sugar. (Side note: read up on the gut-mind connection, there’s some fascinating new research on how gut health is directly connected to mental health).\n\nAnyway, my dietician told me that the first thing I needed to do to get my health back is to stop the inflammation in my body and fix my gut flora, which means that I needed to follow an elimination diet. For the past 6 months, after lots of tests, I’ve cut out gluten, dairy, grains, seed oils, sugar and artificial sweeteners, alcohol, white potatoes, peanuts, oats. I basically just eat meat/fish, non-starchy vegetables and fruits, some nuts. I only drink water and the occasional cup of tea. I take a probiotic everyday (I use Align) and supplement with magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin C before bed. I also do a lot of water fasting to regulate my hormones.\n\nLike quitting any addiction, the first few weeks were tough. I had to fill up my schedule with work and activities so that I couldn’t think about food. I signed up for evening and weekend lessons (painting, ceramics, guitar, drumming), I signed up for worksho",

I have more energy, full bowel movements every day. \n\nI can send you my meal plan if you want but it’s a measured amount of: protein + vegetable + whole grain or starchy vegetable.

Pick the first setting above \"Sedentary\" -- usually something like Lightly Active.    If you are losing bodyfat too fast on that setting after your first two months (the first month is a water loss as well as fat, the second is only fat), that's the setting to adjust.\n\nWeek 2, set it to lose 1 kg a week until you're near 90 kg, then set it to lose 0.5 kg a week.  \n\n> and eating chicken and veg almost exclusively\n\nThis time, eat the foods you typically eat, using portions, patterns, and calorie-smart preparations to lower the calories.

          "I try to manage my food addiction, day by day. Like others I have explored strategies that keep this desire for food at bay and tried to identify when and where risk is higher...and in which contexts. For me, these strategies consists in eating sufficiently in the morning and at lunch (if I fast in the morning for several weeks/months, I have more cravings in the afternoon and evening). My risky period, as many others, is when I have free time, in the evening or week-end. Somehow another weird risky context is when I travel. I guess I took the habit of eating some pastry when I travel by train or plane and now I always feel a desire for sweets when I travel...\n\nI try to make my brain happy at the moment by giving it the impression that there is plenty of food lol. Other strategies that work for me: eating very slow whenever I can (at least 20-30min), including snacks. It is calming and pleasure lasts longer ! Proteins and veggies and fruits help as well. Counting calories helps me a lot, I feel more in control and it's sometimes almost like a game. I sometimes tell myself it's like I am managing my budget. \n\nAh yes, and I never buy sweets, cakes or chips or things I crave and keep them at home. I'm lucky that my partner does not mind. Somehow individual portions (müesli or protein bars) at work in my office are OK. But a cookie box or full cake is fatal... !\n\nAt the moment (since 1 month) I am trying to implement things that will work in the long-term/forever. This works for me as I do get to eat things I like. I may just maintain or lose weight extremely slowly but it makes me feel much better/calmer, not craving things...hope it helps !",

          "First for me it was accepting that I was a food addict. Really, truly accepting that. It's hard because some people don't believe it's a thing. It 100% is. I don't just eat because I don't know better that some foods are bad for me, or because I like the taste. I truly use food in the same way other people use drugs or alcohol. \n\nOnce I discovered this I went on a journey of discovery. OA wasn't for me - I can't deal with all the lingo and the meetings and the spirituality. But I found Bright Line Eating. Read the first book and then just went all in. The meal plans aren't for everybody and some people will say they are too restrictive. It is really genuinely for addicts. In the same way that not drinking EVER AGAIN seems unnecessary to someone who doesn't have a drinking problem, these meal plans will feel OTT to someone who doesn't have a food problem. For me, bounding my food by meal time and by quantities is the most important thing I can do. The no sugar and flour bright lines just make me feel good but the other two bright lines are so vital to me. There's no way to bargain or negotiate around them in the same way that I do when I'm counting calories or points or macros or whatever. \n\nIt's not for everyone I know. But for addicts I think bright line eating is one of the best programs.",

Eventually, you will take more steps forward than backward, and that is how progress, and great achievements, happen.",

When you're full even the tastiest food is non appealing, you still might wanna eat it because of knee jerk reaction but you can control it way easier if full.\n\nIt also helps reminding myself that there's no scarcity, the junk food that I'm craving is not going anywhere and i can have it anytime i want, just not at the moment because I'm trying to be healthy.\n\nSo I've it once a week, though after I've it for the next two days the cravings are higher than usual :(",
          "Evaluate what times of day you order. When that time of day approaches you need to change your routine and do a different activity to replace it. The urges will eventually go away, but it takes time. Addiction to fast food is harder to quit cold turkey. Can you reduce little by little? Tell yourself, if I eat food at home 5 days this week I can go once on Saturday and once on Sunday to get fast food? And reduce it gradually? It’s ok to take baby steps instead of doing a big change all at once. I used to be addicted to fast food too. And TRUST ME, once your body is used to not eating it, when you finally eat it again it will make you feel sick and you also will feel full much faster. If I tried to eat my old Wendys order today I couldn’t finish it! Your stomach will adjust!",
          "Someone else commented it took them a long time and it's never really going to go away, and it is true for me also. Food addiction is so frustrating because it isn't like smoking or drugs where you can quit and never touch those things again. You can't not eat. The most important thing is to accept that this is going to be a lifelong war. The objective is to win *most* battles, because you will lose some (and that's okay).\n\nWhat worked for me in the beginning is eating one meal a day for around 3-4 months. That's including drinks. Only green tea outside of the window. Those meals were mostly nutritious, some were junk, but all within a caloric deficit. I didn't tell myself I couldn't eat this or that. That's a recipe for disaster. I just had a window in which I could eat whatever I wanted within reason.\n\nThe rest of the time I kept my trap shut and did literally *anything* else. Walk, read, chores. The key is to distract your mind when you start to want food outside of your window, it'll be an hour or so then it will go away. Pretty soon your body will adapt. You'll get there when you will still be thinking about food, about eating, but it won't take over your brain completely.",
          "What I did to overcome my addiction was by accepting it, compromising, and taking control of my body. Food isn’t like other addictions. You can’t go cold turkey and quit. You have to consume it every day, and you have to fight against your addiction every time you eat a meal. My key to finally getting better was to stop fighting. To indulge myself, but in a more responsible manner. \n\nI eat enough to satiate myself, and never more or less. I don’t do any crazy diets that I won’t stick with, and I still eat the foods I like. But now, they’re treats, and simply limited. There was a time where I would spend entire paychecks on eating fast food every day. Now I have it every couple days, and never more than my calorie limit. I still ate pie on Christmas and will eat cake on my birthday, but I’ll make sure to take note of how many calories, and space out that eating in a way to leave me satiated as long as possible. \n\nThis often means dealing with a state of marginal hunger. Nothing bad, but not unnoticeable. When that happens, I work out. It makes the deficit easier, distracts me from the hunger, and makes me less inclined to binge or eat because I don’t want to ruin my progress. And because I do it so frequently, my mood and health has improved vastly, making dieting even easier.\n\nThe second big key component to my acceptance was realizing that humans are creatures of habit, and that eating had become an unhealthy habit for me. Eating whenever sad, stressed, or bored had become ingrained as me. Our habits are weapons that can be used powerfully in our favor or come back to bite us. So I started learning how to control my habits. When I really wanted to cope with food, I would oblige, eating something light like a fruit or veggies. And whenever possible, I would choose not to eat at all until after the strong urge subsided. Eventually, these actions caused the habit to break. On the other hand, I built up the healthy habit of exercise as a fail safe. I don’t particularly",
          "Read about why whole foods are good for you. There is plenty of literature available describing the known benefits of eating them and data correlating them with overall positive health outcomes. There also may be benefits that science hasn’t fully grasped yet (phytonutrients, gut impacts, etc). I like How Not to Die by Michael Greger.\n\nOn the flip side, read into why heavily processed foods aren’t good for you. Plenty of literature here too. In addition to not being as nutritionally optimal as whole foods, these are often engineered to be craved, hunger-promoting, and habit-forming, whereas whole foods are not. I recommend reading anything by Michael Moss.\n\nFinally, as I’m sure you’re aware, knowledge doesn’t necessarily translate into action alone. You have to “believe” in the knowledge in order to actually act in accordance with it. Beliefs around undesirable habits can be deep-rooted, complex, and sticky. “Eating this is the only thing that will heal my pain” and “to not eat this would require undue suffering” are beliefs I’m sure you’re familiar with. It’s very difficult to act in defiance of these beliefs regardless of what you “know”. However, if you understand the architecture of belief and how it can be changed, you will realize that some strategic temporary suffering, done with intention and understanding, will deliver you to a different set of beliefs that is more aligned with your goals - at which point the “suffering” ceases but the new behavior remains. YMMV but my personal recommendations for this include the book This Naked Mind by Annie Grace, St. Augustine’s Confessions (world’s oldest autobiography, about a man whose urges and actions defy what he “knows” to be right), and weirdly enough the film The Village by M. Night Shyamalan (watched as a metaphor for the above).",
          "The pleasure I gain from food is stronger than my will to lose weight. But, I really want to lose weight. Frustrated. What do I do?. I feel like I have an addiction. I always feel like I need food in my vicinity (constant snacker). Like, if its not around me I feel \"deprived\" of something. I have very little self control so moderation tends to not work for me.\n\nI've come to the realization that the \"convenience\", \"reliance\", and \"pleasure\" that food brings to me is higher than my will to consistently lose weight, even thought I've wanted to lose weight for years now and have been tying for most of my life. The dopamine rush I get from eating something sweet for instance physically impacts me, and, I feel like I've gained a dependency on food as a result.\n\nI at least workout 4 days a week to combat my binging but even that is becoming tiresome. I'm afraid I'm going to eventually lose the will to get healthy entirely and that my weight will skyrocket.\n\n**I guess my question is, what has enabled you to view the journey of losing weight as more desirable than the pleasurable effects /  feelings food gives you?**",
          "Here’s the thing I’ve realized about my relationship with food: it’s no different than a heroin addiction. The only thing that will truly make you want to change is what AA calls “a moment of clarity”. Hitting rock bottom or some other outside influence is what you need. Breaking or even just living with an addiction is a team effort and to be honest it is very, very hard to do by yourself.",

It's heavily discounted and at full price would be well over my budget. \n\nIt's too sizes smaller than where I am currently, is buying it a terrible idea? I went shopping for dresses and hated it, none of them made me feel a particular way and I've been really nervous about the wedding.\n\nThis is the first I've found that's actually gotten me excited and I can picture myself in.\n\nIs this a good idea or am I kidding myself?\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for the responses! 100% won't be doing it.

When given the choice between my dress in a size that juuuuuuust barely fit 6 months before the wedding and a dress so oversized that I knew it would basically have to be taken apart and reconstructed in my correct size to fit me, I chose the larger dress. \n\nAnd I'm SO glad I did. A month out from your wedding, you don't want to be freaking out that the dress won't fit. I'll never know if the smaller-sized dress would have ended up looking/fitting better, but I know for sure that it being bigger than I needed gave me some desperately needed peace of mind as the wedding drew closer. \n\nGood luck in your weight loss and your marriage! I know you'll find a beautiful dress that's perfect for you",
          "I personally wouldn't do it unless I had already started losing weight and was on a good trajectory.

Would any part fit you now? Has the dress already been altered?",
          "Honestly, it’s a bad idea. 2 dress sizes is about 40lbs and your body shape WILL change as you lose weight. The stress of that hanging over you is going to be awful. Have you tried it on? I know it’s 2 sizes too small, but wedding dress sizes are also small. So if you normally wear a 12 you’d probably end up buying a 16. I was a size 12 when I got married and I think my [dress](https://imgur.com/a/wAnyjL1) was an 18 or 20. Please make sure to put it on & see how much you’d need to lose before buying it too small.",
          "One thing to keep in mind - wedding dresses tend to run 2-3 sizes smaller than your regular clothing sizes. A bride who wears a 10 in daily life might be in a 14 or 16 wedding dress. So before you commit, you might be on the hook for more than two sizes. It might be more like 4-5 sizes.  Have you actually tried it on and know where it's tight? Are those tight places in the same places you lose weight? How much can the dress be altered?",

Good for her, she looked amazing! \nHowever, many many times a year I see the opposite happen, and the bride might loose quite a few pounds, but not enough, or in different places than what will fit the dress, and they have to run around and find something off the rack at the last minute.\nWhat you find you like and looks good on you now may not be the same down the road even if you do lose weight.\nJust a word of caution from experience!",

          "I wouldn’t risk it. I mean, it’s fine if you want to lose weight motivated by your wedding date, but you have no idea how the weight will come off of you, at what rate, and whether the dress will still be flattering if you do.\n\nKeep shopping. You have time.",
          "Yes. You asked this in a wedding dress subreddit as well, and were told repeatedly by other brides who have recently been through the wedding dress shopping/purchasing process that this is just not wise and likely to be a stressful and costly mistake. First, wedding gown sizes do not translate to street sizes. I am now a street size 2-4, and my wedding gown was a 6. Wedding dress sizes tend to be at least 2-3 sizes larger than what your typical street size would be, so unless you took that in to account, or based this off of your actual measurements taken at a bridal salon, this dress is likely 4 sizes too small, not 2. Dresses can usually be let out by about 1 size, maybe 2 if there is enough material, and that kind of alteration is costly, so even if you save quite a bit on the gown, you’ll spend it all back on the alteration. If you are able to lose some weight and tone up, that’s amazing. However, putting that pressure on yourself while also simultaneously facing the stress of planning a wedding is usually a recipe for disaster. Also, just because you lose weight doesn’t mean you necessarily go down in dress size, and especially not down two whole sizes. It’s generally just a bad idea, and not worth it. \n\nTLDR; Everyone on multiple subreddits has told you that you are setting yourself up for a costly, stressful mistake. Please do not do this to yourself. Dresses are meant to fit our bodies, not the other way around ♥️",

At school, one of our \"modules\" was custom bridal and alterations.  That was the first thing my instructor advised all the girls - it can make an ill-fitting dress look much better (almost like magic). I can't count the number of times it looked like we were in for some complicated \"reconstruction\" work and that shapewear went on and whammo! no alterations, maybe some hem work.  Of course, that wasn't every time - there were plenty of times we had to add side panels and fuss around with armholes (usually that was daughter trying to wear mother's/grandmother's dress).

Granted, I'm pushing 50 and my calorie counting isn't as consistent as I would like - but I feel a lot better, I've started swimming again, and I probably look like I'm in my second trimester (rather than my third).

My husband and I have a big trip coming up in May 2024 so that was my original timeline.  We'll see what happens but probably ain't gonna make it.  But c'est la vie.

You don’t always lose weight uniformly. You might lose 30 pounds but still stay thicker in the tush or upper back. \n\nYou may like something different IF you lose the weight because your figure is different.\n\nOr- you might have a dress that’s too small.. \n\nMeet your then go shopping!",

Stick to slow and steady, and try to put the wedding photos out of your mind.

All the working out to lose weight, I apparently gained tons of muscle. The dress was small in the hips/butt, huge in the bust. My shoulders felt massive in the spaghetti straps. \n\nSo, I would not risk it. I was able to order my dress in the exact size and my body changed so much between buying and it arriving. Had I known, I may have picked another dress, despite LOVING my dress. \n\nIf the dress is a the lowest low of your range, you can buy it, take it to a seamstress, and see if it’s even possible. If it’s not, then you can try to resell it. You can also try to see if you can find the exact dress someone else is selling online in your current size on Poshmark, eBay, bridal resellers (depending on how old the dress is).",

          "I haven't really seen people respond with weight training. You're not gonna lose all that weight in three months BUT lifting weights can really change the way a person is built, even at the same weight. It'll definitely help you look more toned and tighten up your build a bit. If you look up \"weight loss from cardio vs weights\" or \"same weight, more muscle\" on Google images you'll see some good examples. You're not going to make crazy progress in three months, but if you do everything pretty well, you'll make noticable progress, especially if you've never lifted before. Lmk if you need any beginner advice",
          "If you were starting at 350lbs then yes. Starting at 177lbs, no. There's nothing wrong with being a size 16 for your graduation. \n\nAim instead to go into graduation feeling and looking your best at the weight you're at then. Maybe aim to lose 10-12lbs in that timeframe if you want to do weight loss. If it's worth doing, it always starts with the 1st pound and takes a long time. It's frustrating and hard, even when the process is simple. \n\nSaying that your weight has fluctuated the last couple of days tells me you might be weighing yourself far too often. Even with a very successful and healthy weight loss plan your weight will go up and down all over the place, especially with your period. Weighing yourself more often than weekly isn't going to tell you anything. Weighing yourself weekly and thinking that the number on the scale between weeks is meaningful is also a mistake. You're looking for an overall trend over a long period of time, not the difference between two points of data. \n\nIf you're consistent, improving your diet (not mostly terms of calories but in terms of feeling really good about the things you're eating), getting more exercise, and building healthy lifestyle habits you'll feel better. You'll be rocking whatever outfit you choose for your graduation, feeling healthy and confident, and knowing that you're graduated and on a great path for yourself. \n\nThe other thing to really work on, which can also be hard, is positive self-talk. Talk to yourself the way you would talk to a good friend. Lift yourself up. Losing weight doesn't give people perfect bodies that they have no issues with. If you're nit-picking your appearance at size 16, you'll do it at a size 8.",

You don't want to lose weight too fast because that can cause health problems and disordered eating.\n\nHowever, you can make big changes in 3 months! Healthy weight loss usually looks like 1-2lbs/week, so you could lose anywhere from 12-24lbs, which will make a difference in how you feel and look.\n\nThe important thing is to stick to a healthy, consistent routine with a realistic calorie deficit. Don't beat yourself up for where you're at now; just move forward toward your goals. The time will pass all the same, so why not accomplish something great with it?",

Also your metabolism would have increased from that and you would enjoy working out again! . Thats what i did and enjoyed some of cheat days i had once a week eating something what i want to eat for lunch or dinner and didnt gain a single weight while i was maintaining for a month.

          "Yes it’s possible. It’s on the aggressive side, but possible. \n\nYou’re talking 20 lbs in 17.4 weeks. A bit over a pound a week. At your size that’s significant. And as you approach 155 it will be more challenging to keep up that pace. So expect the first month to be slightly more productive than the last month. But it is doable with calorie restriction and increased activity. \n\nAs others have said you need to be wary of arbitrary deadlines. What happens when you hit New Year’s Eve and don’t make it? What happens if you do? Do you then go back to your old ways? Do you bounce? Did you actually learn how to live comfortably at the desired weight? \n\nOn January 1st 2025 at 155 lbs you don’t hit a magical finish line where you’re delayed victorious. You then still have to live the rest of your life. As long as you keep that in mind you’ll be fine. \n\nBest of luck hitting your goal. Take it a day at a time.

Weight loss is a prime time for muscle training as you can see progress in both every single week! It's actually really cool to progress in two things for your health benefit at the same time! You can progress by either using a bit higher weights or adding more weight repetitions you do with the weights you have every week. Though ideally you should take a some weeks to a month or so to get used to training.",
          "I lost 15 lbs in the last 3 months by eating less and gradually becoming more active. My main issue with eating was snacking a lot and eating excessively at night. As others mentioned, weight loss does come down CICO. \n\nI went from being completely sedentary to working out consistently 4-5x a week for at least 30 mins. I recommend finding an activity you like to start. If you don't like it, you will struggle to stick to it consistently. I literally started by playing Just Dance a few times a week. Now I like to do HIIT workouts videos with weights. This is just what has worked for me personally. I think you can definitely lose 20lbs by the end of the year.",
          "I did it in that timeframe, but I am a man so for a woman it would have to be more extreme. \n\nPowerlifting 3x per week, long long walks\n\nWeekly body comp scans to ensure minumal muscle loss\n\nHuge egg white omelette for breakfast, small lunch, protein shake for dinner (fruit and vegetables included with each meal) \n\nTons of fiber pills and diet soda. \n\nI lost all that weight super rapidly for a professional theatre audition. I have always played the dad or funny sidekick due to my size.

Intimidating for sure, but also so rewarding. \n\nDont recommend. But it’s possible.",
          "Realistically, no. \n\nYou should not lose more than 1-2 pounds a week (I also hear 0.5-1% of bodyweight per week), meaning in 12 weeks, you *may* be able to lose 20 pounds. \n\nIf you try to lose weight faster than that, it becomes unhealthy and you’re much more likely to binge or immediately gain the weight back (and most of the time gain more than you weighed in the first place).",
          "My dietician told me that losing 4 to 8 pounds a month is safe. So that means you’ll be okay but you should make sure that you have a balanced and nutritious diet add strength training so you don’t end up losing muscle mass cuz it’s really important for weight loss as it helps with your metabolism etc",
          "Man, that’s about 2.5lbs per week.  That’s really fast, and probably isn’t very healthy to do, especially if you aren’t doing it under doctor’s supervision.\n\nI’d say aim for more like 20-30lbs of weight loss in 5 months, which is still pretty significant.",
          "Definitely possible. A bit of an aggressive goal, but 5 lbs lost a month isn’t a big stretch, especially at the beginning of the process.\n\nExercise is great for helping the weight loss process, but the real thing that matters is eating less calories than you burn in a given day. A phrase that gets shared a lot here is, “You can’t outrun a bad diet.”\n\nFind out your TDEE (someone else linked it) and then subtract 500 from that. That’s how many calories per day you should be eating to lose about 1 lb per week. You can do 750 if you have the willpower, but I’d say start with 500 and see how you do with that. If you can stand to subtract an extra 250 per day, go for it, but ease into it. It’s hard enough as is.\n\nAs far as exercise goes, some people swear by walking, others say intense cardio regimens is the way to go, some say lifting and strength training is priority, and of course combinations of all of the above, but honestly, just find something you can do consistently and not hate.",
          "I’ve lost 20 in a little under 2 months, which I think is a lot and that’s a more reasonable pace. Remember that long term weight loss should be the goal. Dropping weight quick isn’t necessary. Do what’s right for your body. Going fast can hurt you and make your weight loss unsustainable.",
          "It hurts to see posts like this. If you hold a healthy amount of weight loss each month for 5 months you'd have a good birthday. You'd feel proud.\n\nYour body wants to lose slow. It needs nutrition.",
          "First get honest with yourself.\n65 lbs in 5 months isn’t likely to happen, but that’s ok as long as you start with that in mind.\nSet a goal, know your progress isn’t linear. Also measure yourself because sometimes your progress won’t be on the scale (like losing 1” on your waist feels as good or better than losing a few lbs).\nBeyond that, know that it’s work. You have to be disciplined. Find meals that you enjoy and consistently eat them.\nDial in an exercise program and stick to it. Doesn’t need to be anything fancy, just get moving daily.",
          "That was quite a generous gift from your mom! Most of your weight loss will come from dietary changes. If you make all your meals at home (and eat healthy 80% of the time) you will see weight loss. You could probably lose 10 lb in the month of September alone by switching to home cooked meals. Don't use a lot of butter/oil. Can you let us know how you typically eat and the foods you enjoy (or hate), we can probably give you some suggestions based on that.",
          "I've lost 30 lbs since December.  20 lbs should be doable provided you are honest with yourself. \n\nBiggest thing that has helped me is downloading the Lose It! app and tracking absolutely everything, and I mean everything, I eat.  Aim for a caloric deficit of 1-2 lbs/week. \n\nAlso buy a cheap food scale from Amazon and use it as much as you can.   You'll be shocked how many calories some portions are if you are just guessing.\n\nFit in cardio and/or strength training when you can, but it's not as important as the diet.",
          "I've lost 35 pounds in about 3.5 months. Granted I started about 30 pounds higher than you. It is doable. 20 pounds at 5 pounds a month is very achievable. Just be kind to yourself if you celebrate holidays this time of year. Bank those in and understand how you will tackle. All I did was use My Fitness pal and calculated my daily calorie goal. I started going to the gym a few days a week (weights only) ans started adding habits. Now I walk minimum of 10k steps a day, hit the gym 5-6 days a week, and added a walk/run program. I still have 20/25 pounds to go to reach my first \"goal weight\" by the end of the year (in time for a beach vacation). I'll be right along with you!\n\nGood luck!",
          "Until you mature you are not going to lose those pounds, you may get rid of them this year, but next year you will have to lose 60. I say this with affection because I have been in your shoes. Doing things wisely is the way to see yourself well,",

          "Honestly I think what you are doing right now is pretty much the best thing anyone can do if they want to lose fat and be healthy (eating at 3-500 kcal deficit, working out 10-30minutes every day). If you can keep it up until next March, or even end of January, you will be happy with your results.  \n\nThe thing about the 15kg in 3 months videos is that while they maybe true, they don't account for losing muscle which is really not recommendable for females. It will in the long run make you look less attractive, less mobile, and gain weight easier. Because muscle weight contains water weight, it will knock the numbers off the scale fast and easy, but it won't make you feel any better or healthier.\n\nAlso keep in mind as you get leaner the harder it will feel for you. I hope you keep up what you are doing. It won't work over night, maybe not even in 30 days, or 50 days. But in 92 days? You bet you will see the changes. Good luck to you.",

          "It’s gonna take up to a year to see meaningful changes at that weight. By that I mean losing weight can be constant, but its likely even with a pretty strict diet you’ll end up losing like 1kg a week. Its gonna be more at the start. It’s gonna take long but hopefully this also means you will build meaningful changes in habits which you can then keep. My suggestion is to concentrate on what you eat and once you reach 200-230lbs start an exercise program. At this weight exercise will do more harm than good. Even walking might be too much. When you’re ready to start to tone your body with weights and core exercises thats when you notice the biggest changes. Im an inch taller and around 165lbs at the moment and still has a little belly, but I look pretty toned otherwise. So I’d say that weight zone looks where you want to be too.",
          "Your rate of loss is not that bad - at 5'2 it's just going to be much slower unless you can do quite a bit of activity. Just how it is, no fun but at least you know it's not you. \n\n2.0 is actually twice the recommended/ studied amount in Canada. It leads many to losing too quickly, and mainly, losing muscle not fat, unless you lift and eat a really significant amount of protein (at least 0,7g per lb when at a deficit.) \n\nEsp with budget being an issue, I would just go back to 1 mg a week.",

Over ~12 weeks, that's ~24lbs. Plus the 5 glycogen pounds to get to ~29 lost. You might not fit in those size 11s, but you could get pretty close.

          "See if you can meet with a dietician. I was 510 pounds when I finally decided to go through with gastric bypass surgery. I had my initial consultation in Feb 2018 and was told that I would have to lose a minimum of 120 pounds on my own before my insurance would pay for the surgery. That’s what started me. The clinic got me set up with a dietitian and she put me on a 1400 calorie a day high protein,low carb and low fat plan. I went cold turkey, all-in following the plan and taking 30 minute walks 3-4X a week. I used the LoseIt! app to track everything. I ended up losing the 120 by September and weighed in at 363 on surgery day in November. Now I’m down to 175 and have kept the weight off almost 5 years. Consistency is key. Also, if you “fall off the wagon” or have a setback (we all do), get right back on the wagon. I think a lot of people have a setback and think “well, I screwed it up already so what the hell” and go on an all out binge; eventually they give up all together. Don’t fall into that trap!

My doctor told me, without a reconstructive surgery I will never run again and I have very high chance of destroying my knee before I get old and spend my old years in a wheelchair.\n\nI didn't listen, I did my own research. The surgery would put me out of action unable to walk for many months and about a year before I could even attempt to start running.

          "Wtf if wrong with your husband? That’s incredibly messed up and mentally abusive. It took you nine months to grow that baby, it’s going to take AT LEAST that to get to around where you were, and I say that as someone who is 13 months postpartum. It took me six months to get back to my pre baby weight (which was technically overweight) and I still have about 20 pounds to get to a “healthy” bmi. Six months postpartum and 10 lbs down is fantastic. I didn’t even have the mental/physical strength to do anything besides survive until six months post baby (when I started dieting). And you know what my husband said about it? Absolutely nothing. \n\nSo much has changed about your body in so many ways that you’re not going to be exactly the same as you were. Even if you’re at the same weight, your body is going to be differently shaped BECAUSE YOU GREW A HUMAN INSIDE OF YOUR BODY. If he’s never done that then he can shut the hell up. And I totally understand wanting to look a certain way and wishing it went faster, but that’s how it’s going to go for now, especially at six effing months postpartum! Your body is still adjusting and trying to get its chemicals right (especially if you’re breastfeeding).\n\nCan you imagine your husband acting like that to your child?? Because you can bet if he does/says those things to you he’s going to act like that towards your kid. You need to give him a reality check. You’re doing fine and you’ll get to where you get to when you get to it! Like damn.  \n\nEdited to change months postpartum, but the rage still stands regardless of timetable",

The discussions about losing weight the \"right way not the easy way\" (like there's any way of losing weight that's easy, yeah, we'd all be size 0, right?) remind me when people give their unwanted opinions about pregnancy & childbirth - You needed IVF or a surrogate?  Oh, that's not the \"right\" way to get pregnant.   You had to have an epidural or a c-section? Oh, that's not the \"right\" way to deliver a baby.  You're not a real Mom unless you conceived on the 1st try & then delivered vaginally after enduring 24 hours of labor with no pain meds.  Any way other than that & you did it the easy way.  Well you know what, nobody gives you a fucking medal when that kid comes out.  You know what you do get?  A baby, along with the joy & pain of raising a kid.\n\nSame thing with losing weight, there's no fucking medal so it doesn't really matter how you do it.  If you're successful you get the joy of a healthier body & the pain of regret for all that time you spent at an unhealthy weight.\n\nI'm very fortunate to be having great success with Ozempic.  I've been asked directly & indirectly (multiple times) by family, close friends, acquaintances & customers & some people have just flat out said to me you must be taking SOMETHING.

I haven't told them shit because I just don't want to hear any of their opinions about it. So I just deflect.\n\nAll I've said is that \"I'm working hard on it\". And that is the real honest truth.  You don't just take a shot & the weight falls off, but that is certainly how it would be viewed & that's why I have a problem with admitting it.  Do I feel like I'm a liar?  Yes.

If your husband has the mental capacity to focus on your physical appearance, then it sounds like he better step up more with baby caring duties because that’s just too much time to waste on menial things in comparison to caring for a new born that BOTH of you are now responsible for caring for. Having a child is hopefully an equal decision on both partners, but biologically the women’s body is what goes through the intense changes of carrying the baby. You kept a fertilized embryo to a full blown miracle of a baby in that body!!! The fact that his not only not thankful for all that your body has done to create this new life into your family, but has the time to focus on the appearance change that he doesn’t find to his preference, is so entitled and ignorant. Weight loss and body health maintenance is a marathon. Im sure you will find the balance between caring for the new life of your child and caring for your own physical body in time - but I think that time is years, not months. Your husband need to either step in line and refocus his priorities, or go to therapy and work on not projecting his own menial needs onto you in such an external way. Very inconsiderate of him. Please focus on caring for your new born and finding a sane new normal through all immense changes in your life mama!",

They also took out my tonsils, adenoids and uvula and it helped but did not make it go away.

          "Obstructive sleep apnea has ruined my life and I want it back. \n\nI got fired from the highest-paying job I’d ever had last year because I was too tired to do the work. I was working from home and would leave work early to go sleep. If I tried to make myself stay up I’d stare at the screen and be unable to concentrate or understand what I was seeing. It was really scary—I was worried I had some sort of brain damage. I was worried I’d never be able to work again, or if I was I’d just be miserable because I’d have no energy for anything else. \n\nIt took several months but I eventually got a sleep study and found I had sleep apnea. 17 times an hour, my throat closes on itself and I stop breathing, and although I’m not conscious of this, I wake up enough to resume breathing and never enter a phase of deep sleep. While there are several factors that cause OSA, in a given person, having more body fat around your neck increases your risk, and neck circumference is one of the main ways they assess you for it. \n\nLooking back over the last 5 years or so of my life, there have been so many areas where I just accepted I couldn’t do something because I was too tired. I have lost friendships because I was too exhausted to engage with issues in the relationship. I’ve given up on a lot of goals and interests. I’ve sort of defined my identity around having no energy and being unable to follow through on things. It makes me sad to think about. \n\nBefore I got this diagnosis I was afraid there was something permanently broken about me and I’d be disabled for the rest of my life by it. It made me want to die, and I’m not exaggerating. I couldn’t imagine a life where I wasn’t miserable all the time unless something changed. \n\nThe two main treatment options for sleep apnea are a CPAP machine which blows air into your lungs while you sleep, and a fitted dental appliance that holds your jaw in a position that opens up your airway.

My butt looks amazing. My arms are toned and my legs are slender. I even have a bit of a waistline now!\n\nBut GOD DAMN IT I cannot lose any fat from my abdomen and it is PISSING ME OFF.\n\nI hold all my excess weight in my belly, back, and breasts. I’m built like Winnie the Pooh. My legs are so small but I’m very top heavy and look completely disproportionate. \n\nI am so so so jealous of women/AFAB people who have a more even fat distribution. Excess body fat isn’t even my biggest issue. I would still want to get healthy, but I would be SO much more confident if I had a more natural looking female body. I look like I’ve had three kids. The idea of having a stomach that isn’t convex is alien to me. \n\nAll clothes look horrible on me. I feel so uncomfortable in everything I wear because some part of me is always stretching my clothes in the wrong way even if it fits everything else. I never ever feel cute. I just want to hide all the time.\n\nMost of the issue is genes and stress eating, but I also take a few medications that cause weight gain as well and one of them gives me terrible moon face. I don’t even recognize myself. I can’t be around reflective surfaces because all I do is stare at my double chin and think about how horribly I’ve failed myself.\n\nBeing pretty isn’t everything, I know that. I have a rich inner life where I contemplate other things that aren’t so superficial and shallow.

You wear an underlayer so they don’t hurt the way actresses complain about, but a well-fitted corset is designed to help you build out a more hourglass silhouette. Easiest place to get one would be a local renaissance festival, if you don’t have one nearby you could look at a ren faire’s vendor list and see who has an online presence. \n\nHonestly, historical fashion in general would help out a lot of women. You build out the silhouette rather than forcing your body to be a particular shape.",

Still highlights my shape but covers the soft tummy. \n\nFocus on dressing w/what DOES work rather than what displeases you. Tank tops that show off your arms, and not tight in the midsection. If you wear leggings or tight pants, wear a top that’s loose enough and covers the tummy if yours is noticeably puffy. \n\nI got rid of all my unflattering clothes and now wear only things that are my colors and flatter my body shape. It gets easier if you wear clothes that flatter your form and aren’t too tight in the problem areas.",

Many of them do dance and choreography and look extremely feminine.\n\nTry wrap dresses with solid, bold/neutral colors or large fun prints. Small flower prints in dull colors actually highlight weight, in my opinion. Shape wear can also help significantly but be sure to get the right size, if it's too tight it won't help. Platform/wedge shoes also help with posture.\n\nI am not apple shape but gained weight while struggling with endometriosis and after having abdominal surgery for it. A lot of weight, that I don't like how it looks, is in my tummy and upper back, so I've had to dress my body as it is because life isn't stopping and losing weight takes time.\n\nTighter clothes tend to make you look bigger unless you are a super model size... and even then. The number on the dress/shirt is less important than how it fits you. I see a lot of women with a variety of body types that need to size up and give their body some room. You can always get clothes altered down to fit you as you lose weight.",

It does really annoy me but I am really quite glad my legs remain thin because I think it gives more of an illusion of being thin when I need to feel marginally self confident.\n\nMy aim is to look good clothed, because my boobs are extremely heavy and just hang down and I don't think that will ever change.",

I started thinking about all the incredible women behind me, my mom and grandma and my grandma's mom and all the ladies behind her. I know what my people looked like and they were never what you'd call thin, but I sure af would want them next to me if shtf, you know?

I think it's possible that I may at some point become more lean if I keep working hard, but I'll never be thin and I am super ok with that ☺️🥰\n\nYou sound incredibly strong and you should be so proud of what your body is capable of exactly as you are.

Idk what happened.” I’m sure everyone reading this has heard something along those lines from multiple people. You might have even said something like this at some point in your life.

But 10 lbs of water weight on your body I think would create symptoms such as shortness of breath and swelling in the lower legs. Now you have edema and it goes away then I would say you lost some water weight. I think the body mobilizes fat initially. The improvements are around the middle. Excess water is not as likely to be there ( unless you have liver disease) \n\nSo what I am saying is I think it's more logical you lost fat and maybe some of the food material in your gut.

Every day until that cardio appointment, I am piling on the pounds.

          "Eating Once a Day due to Vyvanse & Ozempic. This is not something I EVER thought I would be asking guidance on, but it’s stressing me out, and I need help. I'm currently experiencing something I would have loved a few years ago, but now I’m unsure if it’s healthy or not. \n\nI struggled with Binge Eating, a good chunk of my life, and I’ve always carried extra fat, especially around certain times in my life when significant changes happened.\n\nI reached my highest weight ever, of 266 pounds, and I’m 5’7. I finally decided I need to talk to a doctor and see what’s going on with me. I was eating excess food from binging sometimes, but not to the point of gaining 60 pounds in less than two years. \n\nI spoke with the Doctor, and she had me sleep-tested, and it came back I have sleep apnea, nothing severe but nothing mild either. I have other medical stuff that may contribute to the situation, but I won’t dive too deep into it. But I have ADHD, clinical depression, and often I’m very fatigued. I remember as a young child being exhausted ALL the time.\n\nI eventually opened up to my doctor about my binge and disordered eating. She decided to refer me to a specialist who could diagnose me and get me further help. \n\nThey switched my ADHD medication from 20mg of Biphentin to 50mg of Vyvanse (this treats binging and ADHD). This new medication is a GAME changer, my binging has disappeared completely, and focus has significantly improved, and lots of energy, but I was instantly noticing my desire to eat at all had disappeared. I was disgusted by food a lot of the time. Once in a while, I will have a desire to eat and enjoy it. \n\nThen I decided to proceed with getting on Ozempic (a medication that is similar to a hormone, curbs hunger, blocks a hormone that causes your liver to release sugar, and makes you feel full longer). This medication is excellent, I inject it once a week, and I’m already noticing improvement. \n\nNow, you’re probably wondering what’s the problem. Well, I’ve been speaking with a nutritionist for months now, and she encourages intuitive eating and eating every few hours, and she says this increases your metabolism, which I believe. She’s a trained professional, and everything she says makes sense. But then, so many people preach the science behind intermittent fasting and the effectiveness it has on your body. And so many people go back and forth on what’s good for your body. \n\nWith these two medications I’m on, I am never hungry. I could probably go days without eating if I didn’t feel like I would pass out. So I’m forcing myself to eat something in the evening. But I have constant guilt that I’m screwing up my metabolism, and I’m going to train my body to hold onto even more fat. But I so badly don’t want that to be true because eating more than one meal a day right now is so exhausting for me. I want to have a healthy metabolism and free myself from this weight I carry. The only way I can do that is with these medications removing my eating disorder and curbing my appetite, but at the same time, am I screwing my body up more by only eating once a day? \n\nSomeone help me, please!",

Binge eating is a symptom of adhd and when I told my doctor I was having binge eating episodes she switched my adhd medication from concerta to Vyvanse, and explained that some people get prescribed Vyvanse strictly for binge eating disorder. People don’t realize it’s a mental health issue. I take that with a probiotic as well, I found a probiotic helps with unhealthy cravings because it keeps my guy balanced.

The nice thing about stimulant meds is that if it’s the wrong one, you’ll probably know pretty quick, and it’s only going to kick around in your system for a day or two.",
          "Why are you scared of taking a medication that could literally change everything? ADHD isn’t nothing, it’s a huge factor here. Vyvanse isn’t magic but it’s pretty significant in terms of known effects on disrupting binge eating and allowing a person to just..stop when they are done.",

          "Heya, former BED sufferer with ADHD here. I figured out after working through some mental issues I had that I used food as a crutch and a huge source of dopamine that I was lacking by default from having adhd. I had a habit of finding something that bought me joy and latching onto it at the expense of my health- it was fast food and yummy snacks. I was literally haunted daily by thoughts of eating and where I’m going to go buy yummy (but unhealthy) food, I’d go a couple of days eating normally and then order 100+ dollars worth of takeout and beer, repeat et nauseum for years.\n\nI got on vyvanse and literally overnight my obsession with food disappeared. I’m never excessively craving foods so my body actually knows when it’s time to eat instead and sends me normal hunger cues instead of wanting to constantly stuff my face or buy snacks even if I was full or had eaten enough. For the first time in my life I could eat 10 Doritos and then put the packet away instead of eating the whole thing. I’ve lost almost 50kg total since starting my weight loss journey and vyvanse played no small role in this. As I’m typing this I’m eating a stuffed roasted bell pepper for my lunch (at a reasonable hour) and 2 years ago that was unfathomable to me. \n\n I seriously recommend giving it a shot. If it works for you It will drastically improve your health, appearance and bank account in the long run. \n\nAll the best <3",

          "You should just try the vyvanse. \n\nI am your exact height and was even 10 lbs more than you at 230 when I started. This was in June 2023.  I weighed in at 165 last Sunday. I was prescribed Vyvanse for ADD but it has helped me do the damn thing as far as my weight loss goals. \n\nI have seen some people say that it didn’t work for them to curb binging or overeating because they would still eat when they weren’t hungry. For me- it has turned off 90% of the food noise. In the beginning I didn’t want to eat anything at all. Now the appetite suppression has lessened but I’ve solidified habits that keep me tethered to my weight loss goals. \n\nBut most importantly, I WANTED to lose weight and was ready to change. I have a co worker who started at about the same time and has lost only a few lbs. the vyvanse will get you started but if you’re determined to eat - you will. However, if you’re determined to fix your bad food habits- vyvanse is a great tool. On the days I don’t take it- I do not sidle up to the buffet or mindlessly get into the chips as I might have before. Why not?  Because I have established new habits that say I don’t do that anymore.\n\nUse the meds to help you establish the habits of a “thin” person. I snack on fruits and veggies between meals. I go to the gym 5x a week and when I don’t go I take at least a short walk just to keep up the habit of being active. \n\nIf it doesn’t “work” for you- do not throw up your hands. It WILL suppress your appetite and allow you to focus on things other than food but you must be committed to becoming a new and healthier person or else you will binge or overeat  regardless especially at night when it starts to wear off. I even have a plan in place for this- I plan a sensible snack that I know I can fit in when I start getting a little hungry near bedtime. Don’t be afraid to start! Just do it with the mindset that it’s a tool- and that you still must be committed to your goals !",

Full after a meal 1/4 the size of whatI used to eat.\n1. Full for hours after the small meal, instead of 20-30 minutes after binge eating like before.\n1. Able to stop eating when I feel full instead of keeping on stuffing myself.\n1. Not being obsessed with food and thinking about it all day.\n\nAnd just like you OP that voice (in my case I would call it more an impulsive thought than a voice per se) IS GONE. My brain doesn't reminds me food exist 24/7 and I MUST eat NOW cuz I'm HUNGRY.\n\nYesterday I fucking cried in front of my dinner because I was full after a few bites and I had no problem stopping eating and no urge to binge. I was full and happy and when I realized how easy it was to stop eating... I fucking cried. This NEVER happened to me before.\n\nJust like you this THING has kept me overweight, guilty, ashamed and miserable for over 3 damn decades and I was one pill away to eat like a normal person?\n\nI wish I'll have as much success as you did on Ozempic.

          "Finally getting meds for my anxiety disorder and finding out I have ADHD put this in perspective for me and made me realize how much it was affecting my weight loss. The ADHD led to impulsive eating mainly because of the lack of serotonin from the anxiety disorder. Food was an easy dopamine rush so it was a constant thought and a constant struggle not to eat.\n\nOnce I got meds for the anxiety/depression I found myself just not thinking about food constantly (because I didn't need the constant dopamine rush) And as I became conscious of the impulsive eating due to the ADHD, it was a lot easier to curb and be conscious of when it wasn't also filling a brain chemistry hole. \n\nTaking care of your mental health can lead to massive breakthroughs in your physical health/weight loss.

          "I don't think there's one secret.  It depends on the person.  \n\nAs a former emotional eater and general observer of human behavior, I do think it's important to break the circuit in our brains between emotion and eating.  I think it's useful to tackle this sort of thing head-on.  \n\nFor example, an alternative to the hobby developing is to simply focus on being ok with not having excitement.  There are many tactics that can be used;  negotiating a smaller amount of eating, thinking about the impact on our future selves, treating the situation as an observer and imagining how we would advise ourselves, running screaming away from the situation (literally if necessary), delaying the eating for a period and using that period to re-evaluate with permission to eat if we still want to later, and so on.  \n\nSome people do better with gradual reductions, others with a cold-turkey approach.  But however it's done, the habit of 'I feel this way therefore I'll eat' needs to change.  The most healthy way IMO is to replace it with 'I feel this way and I don't like it, but I'm not going to react instinctively.  I'm going to lean into this and examine it and not try to suppress it with anything'.",
          "deal with your emotions in another way. overate a bit? oops. anyway",
          "I think everyone is different.  It helped to find the sources of emotional eating for me.  I had two, restriction and actual emotional eating.  For the emotional eating addressing the uncomfortable emotions and thoughts I was having was key. Writing them down, reframing how I feel about myself.  Also noticing the \"urge\" I get when I want to emotionally eat and \"surf\" it and/or distract it.  Meditation really helps because it teaches you to notice and tolerate all kinds of difficult emotions and to let thoughts go.  I also found the self help book DBT for emotional eating very very helpful.  They helped me map out my behaviour so find the trigger, the emotions and thoughts and then the emotional eating to feel better.  Mapping them out gave me a way to figure out how to disrupt the cycle.  All this seems daunting but I also found that once I started to really notice things, there were patters and very repeated behaviour.  So once I learned to break one part of it, it's transferable skills.  \n\nI differ a little because I also tend to be all or nothing and restriction leads to emotional eating for me as well.    There were days when I'd be happy and emotional eat because it was the only time I could relax and it would be too intense of a feeling when I'm so otherwise wound up.  So addressing that restriction was also really helpful.  If I started saying ok I'm not going to have Taco Bell, I would start craving Taco Bell.  So learning how to eat on schedule, build balanced meals that wasn't too low carb or low cals was important to me.  Not delaying meals, actually having various food in the house and portion control was also a really big part of this.\n\nAre you sure it's the excitement vs the comfort you're getting from food when you have low mood or feeling lonely?  Any way you can start addressing those feelings?",

          "For me specifically, the root was unrecognized anger stemming from my childhood. I hadn't acknowledged my anger, never mind processed it, and I was essentially eating in part to suppress/repress that anger. Therapy helped a lot to learn to process. So basically, that was my reason for emotional eating. For others, it can be due to boredom, stress, anxiety, depression, etc., or a multitude of factors.",
          "These steps laid the ground work that help me avoid emotional eating:\n1. I script my eating. I eat at 9am, noon, 3pm, and 6pm. I eat prepped meals. I finish every day with dessert (a coffee and a protein bar). \n1. I changed my diet to nearly all real/whole foods (my protein shakes and bars are exceptions). \n1. Eating out is planned into my diet. It's not something I do on a whim. \n1. Early on I avoided brining certain foods home. You can't eat it if it's not in your house. (This may be easier said than done for people in shared households).\n\nI put my hunger monster in its place.  I never emotionally ate salmon, strawberries, or brussels sprouts. When the voice in my head tells me I want Burger King. I look at the clock. It's 1pm. I just ate at noon. I tell the monster, I'm NOT starving, I'm NOT even hungry. If I must have something, I'm going to have what I packed for my 3pm snack. \n\nWhen my monster tells me I want Burger King. I also think about what may have just happened. Did I take a stressful phone call? Is my stepson being a brat? How are things between my wife and I? Finances? These are things (for me) that sparked emotional eating. If I, out of nowhere, I get the urge to binge or eat junk food, I look at the clock and ask myself if something is bothering me. \n\nHaving dessert at night gives me something to look forward to and not feel deprived. Barebell protein bars are a real treat. \n\nI had great food over the Holidays, had Red Robin with family recently, and have movie popcorn whenever I go. Sometimes, my wife and I would plan eating out once a week. That would give me the same benefits as my nightly dessert. If the voice tells me I want McDonalds. I'd tell it, that I'm going to eat out Friday night. I tend to look at menus before hand and plan what I will get. I usually cut restaurant foods in half and make 2 meals out of it. Restaurant portions are way oversized. \n\nThese steps, methods, and mindsets helped me. I hope that some of them can be helpful. Get",

Don’t have any distractions, just sit with your food, eat it slowly, taste it, and enjoy it.

          "Thank you for sharing your experience. \n\nI think there’s a lot going on in weight loss medication discourse. I mean, generationally, some Gen X and millennials are so cautious of weight loss drugs because we saw some really harmful ones come and go, with doctors being all too happy to overprescribe things that turned out to be dangerous. People with a history of disordered eating, like me, see some folks talking about the side effects and/or benefits of the current drugs and sometimes recognize our own symptoms which can be truly alarming. And absolutely everyone in our society conflates healthy weight with worth and moral value, so you get some folks who desperately want to parse what the “right” way is to lose weight or pass judgement on who “deserves” to use these medications.\n\nIn the end I have seen some really positive results for folks in my life who have major barriers to losing weight. And that’s incredible, I really celebrate it. *And* there’s every reason for concern about overprescription and pressure to try them on a societal level because all the preconditions for it are absolutely there. *And* that concern is not a reason to invalidate an individual person’s autonomy to try these medications or judge who should or shouldn’t have them. \n\nFor me personally, I researched it and had a consultation, and I came to the conclusion that using these would put me at significant risk of falling back into disordered eating patterns and regaining weight later on. I think people are speaking out about that because we want to reach our peers with similar issues, but of course that’s not the only group that is going to read our words.

I put the meds under the end table by the couch so they’re nearby when my reminder goes off and I can take them. If I’m somewhere else or otherwise busy, I leave the notification up on my phone to remind me they still need to be taken. I set the app to continue to remind me every 30 minutes if I haven’t marked them as taken. So my phone will continue to buzz and annoy me until I take them. When I was on oral contraception and HAD to take the pill at the same time every day, I set a reminder in my phone to go off every day and I set it as the highest priory my phone would allow. So my phone buzzes and rings and annoys me enough to drop what I’m doing and go take my pill. I kept those in my wallet because I always have my wallet with me, whether I’m home or out on the town.

I know you don’t want to hear this, but your mental health needs to come first. You cannot lose more weight until you get your mental health under order. Ask your therapist for some “homework” or some books you can read or YouTube videos to watch since you aren’t able to see them more than once a month.

I still think about food and want to eat, the difference is I don’t feel obsessed or distraught over food on a regular basis. I’m closer to the camp of people who are using it to disrupt binge eating, something I didn’t indulge in (I developed other weird habits like having one bite of everything in my fridge…?) but constantly felt compelled to do.

I know all the tricks to volume eating, CICO, macros vs. micros, increasing activity, getting more fiber & protein, counting weight watchers points, etc... these methods work great for as long as you're able to apply them. Taking antidepressants and birth control made me gain even more. Before these meds, I was always hungry. Always thinking about food.

I'm nowhere near perfect, aesthetically, but I feel so much better than I ever have. The way I'm able to eat now makes me feel like a normal person. I'd never known before what it was like to put down my fork and feel satiated. I knew full and overfull, but never content. I truly believe that some people are just wired differently, and this medication has helped me reset that.\n\nUsing the meds isn't an easy-out. Many people have side effects. Many people still have to apply the basics of weight loss knowledge. Sure, there are those who take the meds, starve themselves, puke themselves skinny, and call it a win.

The best option i found was Latuda, which is \"weight neutral\" meaning it generally doesn't cause gain.

I'm still taking it, but my weight loss slowed down quite a bit after that update.  I'm maintaining at about 53 pounds down, which is great and makes me an \"overweight\" size 12, but I'd like to lose about 20ish more to reach \"normal weight\", which I've never been as an adult.  But I don't think that is due to a lessoning effect of the meds.  My life's been stressful lately and I haven't had the time or energy to focus any mental energy on food choices.  In the past, that would have meant a significant weight gain, so I'm super stoked to be maintaining.  I also still do not feel nearly as hungry as I always did before, and I stay full longer, so the meds are still working and I'm not overeating.  Once I get back to a more even keel on life and am ready to pay some attention again, I'll probably up my dose some more and see if I can take some more pounds off.  Right now, I'm holding at 1.0 mg. I ramped up my dose very slowly.\n\nMy only thing I would add to my prior update is that the constipation did get real at some point after I posted this.  I tried a bunch of things that didn't really help enough.  What did help for me was  that I started taking daily probiotics and a magnesium supplement.  Particularly the magnesium (most people swear by citrate, I actually like glyconate).  If I don't take them, I don't poop, simple as that.  I also take Dramamine about twice a month for queasy days.  My doctor proscribed me some Zofran, but the nausea has only been bad enough once that I decided to take one of those instead of the Dramamine.  I try to avoid all the anti-nausea stuff if I can though, because it makes the constipation worse.  It's a bit of a balance act, but for me at least, it's been relatively minor and manageable, and worth it.\n\nIt really has significantly changed my life for the better, and made losing weight and/or maintaining a lower weight sooo much",

So instead of being super strict give yourself a couple of weeks to eat at maintenance and understand it because when you are at goal you have to have this skill, have to have it.

I lack time as well since I'm home at 5 everyday and I have to be awake by 6 am plus I have to study. \n\nI'm 19F,253 pounds and 5'5.",
          "Hey there! First of all, let me send you a virtual hug and tell you: you are not alone in this. I suffer from depression, and I once worked for two years with a nutritionist to lose 16 kg (35 lbs) only to fall into a depressive episode a year later and gain 25 kg (55 lbs). Shit, that sucks. It also makes total sense, especially if eating is one of your self care/ coping mechanisms. Being depressed is not your fault.   \n\nSo, what helped eventually? One, good treatment for my depression obviously. This is the most important thing. Since you mention meds and therapy, I'm guessing you're working on that already and that's not particularly anything you can do more with.   \n\nTwo, small, small goals. At first, when I started doing this, these goals were not at all diet-related, but more \"taking care of myself\"-related. At my worst point, my goal was brushing my teeth everyday - that's the kind of small I'm talking about.  When I was doing a bit better and started to think about my diet again, I would just start with adding something healthy, rather than immediately cutting back on unhealthy. For example, yes, sure, I ate a frozen pizza for dinner, but I'll also have an apple. Also, don't set the bar too high right away. Home-cooked meal is a win, even if I just threw some pre-boiled potatoes and vegetables into a pan. Do what is achievable and celebrate the small accomplishments.  Build from there, when you can.   \n\nThree - and I know this can be really hard - be kind to yourself.  Don't impose the standard of others. Yes, walking for an hour would be great, but it's not in the cards right now for you. Right now I'm doing quite well and going out for a run is easy. And then there are the times when simply getting out of bed is a 100 times harder than it is to go run for an hour. I try to accept these times when they come and not judge myself for what I can't do, while still trying to set the smaller goals.  \n\nAlso, lastly, I don't know if this is possible for you, but",

          "Wow, this is some unrealistic, sense of entitlement. \"I put in work to be fit so everyone else should have to.\" This is the same delusional mentality that because you think you work harder than someone you should be in a higher position than them. It's not fair that you put in \"serious effort\" (assuming yours is more serious than someone else whose serious efforts have failed) and someone else is able to use a medication to aid them is so unfair. Guess what? Life isn't fair. Our society has never been fair. Get over thinking you're entitled to more than someone else because you had to struggle a little bit. Focus on your own achievements and stop making life a competition against other people or you're going to live in a really unhappy place where you are constantly losing.   \nI'm not on Ozempic, but I do know people that have worked really hard to lose weight and can't, and if they can take an opportunity that's presented to them, to make their quality of life better, then they should be able to without a bunch of assholes butting into their business.",

          "OP has received some really awesome advice on this thread. Just to add a thought, the thing that stands out for me about your post is that you say that the weight has piled on due to depression. I’ve recently gone from 215 pounds (highest recorded weight, I was a lot larger than this but not able to face the scale initially) to 170 as of this morning. \n\nFrankly I could not have done so had I not had a really awesome counsellor for about 3 months who helped me through some things that (at the time) felt unrelated to my weight. I didn’t lose the weight while having therapy or anything and it still took another 6 or so months before I got serious about the weight loss but learning self love makes taking care of yourself a lot easier to do! \n\nBest of luck in your journey, I honestly believe you can do this!",

          "You need to make an appointment with your doctor ASAP and describe these thoughts your having.  Your physical health is secondary to your mental health right now; I've been every weight on the spectrum from thin to morbidly obese, and I can tell you that losing weight doesn't fix major depression.  There are a wide range of medications that can help, but consider asking your doctor if you can try a drug like wellbutrin if they do indeed diagnose depression.  Unlike many other antidepressants, wellbutrin has the happy side effect that it can help suppress appetite (so much so that it is a key part of a combo drug called contrave). \n\nAnd if you aren't already, consider getting into counselling.  One of the best things I ever did for myself was to lean heavily into counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy to get over shame and guilt associated with things like weighing myself and tracking my food.  It was actually one of the biggest barriers I had to successful weight management because in the past I'd have one \"bad\" day and I'd go into a huge bout of self-recrimination and end up going completely off the rails.  People think weight management is all about diet and exercise, but in reality there are a whole bunch of psychological and social barriers that sabotage long-term weight management.  Multifaceted problems require multifaceted solutions, and you should pull out all the stops on using every single helpful tool you can to address all these aspects.\n\nAs far as your physical health is concerned, get a blood workup done.  I would be amazed if you don't have pre-diabetes or even diabetes if you are very obese.  If that is the case, there is a relatively new class of medications called GLP-1 agonists that can really help with blood sugar in a way that facilitates weight management.  The most commonly prescribed are victoza/saxenda/ozempic/wegovy/mounjaro.",
          "Hey, I am so sorry for what you’re going through. I bet you’re absolutely exhausted right now. It is super hard to lose weight when you have health problems, and that most definitely includes mental health. You’re pushing yourself really hard right now. Depression is one hell of an illness, because in your post I see a person who worked very hard to lose weight, succeeded, and then hit a wall with health issues. You are still down over 20 lbs! If you could take off the depression goggles (god they suck so much) you’d see someone who is strong and determined and is fighting really hard. \n\nI think the most important thing right now is to be kind to yourself. This isn’t a failure, it’s a temporary setback. They happen, unfortunately, but they are normal and you can move past them. Remember, every little change you make matters. That goes for mental and physical health. Every bit of exercise, every time you choose a healthier food option, you are moving in the right direction. You don’t have to exhaust yourself trying to lose weight. Despite the sub we’re in, maintenance might be a better option for the moment. You don’t need to weigh all your foods now, just focus on eating as well as you can – lots of veggies, fruits, and lean protein. If cooking is hard, go for frozen veggies. Get stuff pre-cut if you can swing the extra cost. Swap out a few of the higher calorie options. \n\nYou don’t have to walk a mile every day right now. However, going for a walk will probably help your depression. You don’t have to do too much or go too far, just stretch your legs a little. Bonus points if you get outside on a nice day for some sunshine. Do you like audiobooks? I like listening to them while I do something else like go for a walk. Then I got a little exercise *and* read a book, look at me go. Haha. Many local libraries let you check out audiobooks for free. I got walking more regularly again after a surgery by listening to the Hunger Games. Just me and Katniss, total badasses, yo",

So, pour yourself into that. Learn some skills and practice them. Even talk about this with your therapist. \n\nIt is hard, but work on keeping your eyes on your own paper. If you've been consistent, celebrate that. If you see scale progress, be happy for yourself. Great for people getting there faster, and it's okay to wish it was easier, but you have to pull yourself back to your own numbers, your own habits, etc. It's easy to fall into looking at someone else's lane so much that you stop making forward progress in your own, which is the only one that really matters for you.",

Give yourself some grace and focus on small palatable changes you feel capable of making while you’re feeling low. Maybe walking daily is hard. But if you’re in a good mood, feeling energetic, take that walk! Being outside is also good for your mental health. Changes don’t have to be huge and broad sweeping to make an impact. Maybe your goal for tomorrow is to drink your recommended water or cut out one snack. It’s really hard to take care of your body when your head isn’t feeling quite right. Small, achievable goals like “today I will walk for ten mins” or “today I’ll hit my water goal” are not just good for your physical health.

I realized that losing weight comes down to what you do and what you eat (duh, you say), but what I mean is you don't focus on the end aspiration \"to be fit/healthy\" or goal \"I want/need to lose 100 pounds\". You focus instead on all the little building blocks that make up your day, every day. \n\nAnd changing my life didn't have to be this massive, herculean effort of suffering versus willpower.

All your unhealthy snacks are in the dark, spidery basement so maybe you snack on the healthy foods nearby. You swapped out your large dinner plates for salad plates that you naturally eat less on. You keep your tv closed in a cabinet or the remote out of arms reach so you need to get up more.

          "Some physiology helped me understand cravings. And this was how it was explained to me by a dr years ago so hopefully I’m remembering right. \n\nIn your gut there are 3 categories of bacteria. The good bacteria, the bad bacteria, and the neutral bacteria. If there are more good bacteria than bad, the neutral bacteria will aid the good bacteria. If there are more bad bacteria, the neutral bacteria will aid the bad bacteria. \n\nThose bad bacteria feed off of sugars that make it through the digestive system and to encourage the host (you) to continue to feed those bad bacteria, the bad bacteria secretes a chemical that causes sugar cravings. \n\nThose vanilla latte cravings you are getting… that is the bad bacteria saying “feed me!!” \n\nNow, when you don’t feed the little bastards, they start secreting hormones that cause headaches and general malaise.  So you now have the carrot and the stick. The craving and the punishment as it were. \n\nRead a book called “atomic habits” and you will see how cravings help us to establish habits. And how habits rule our daily lives. \n\nRight now, you need to start new habits. Make a coffee at home with a low-fat/low sugar vanilla sweetener. Drink that on your way to work and you will have bypassed the normal trigger for getting your morning sweet fix. \n\nFor each coffee run, drink 8oz of water before you have a cup of coffee. By the time you are done with that water, you won’t want the coffee. \n\nWhen you get home, have a quick 100cal or less snack waiting for you. Enjoy that and then wait an hour. By the time dinner is ready, you won’t have that same craving for a high calorie dinner. \n\nLook for 100 cal deserts that you like and have them on hand (mine is a chocolate icecream bar from Costco that is 100 cal) and when you need that sweet kick, that is what you get. Enjoy it and wait an hour. Keep drinking water.  \n\nYou will notice the cravings get weaker over time as those bad bacteria die off and your good bacteria start taking over your dige",
          "The most effective thing you can possibly do (assuming you haven't already) is to cut out all sugary drinks from your life. This is the mother of low-hanging fruit. You can still eat junk food sometimes, but getting in the habit of cutting out sugary drinks from your diet will pay huge dividends for the rest of your life.\n\n**Why Sugary Drinks Are Uniquely Fattening**\n\nSugary drinks are even more fattening than junk food. At least with junk food, you’re ingesting calories when you feel like eating something. But not only are sugary drinks full of calories and less filling than junk food, but people often drink sugary drinks *when they don’t even feel like eating*.\n\nHunger and thirst are two completely different things. You can be thirsty but not hungry. And you can be hungry but not thirsty. We’re evolved to sate our hunger with calories, and quench our thirst with zero-calorie water.\n\nBut sugary drinks throw a wrench in this ancient metabolic formula. People drink sugar to quench their thirst with lots of calories that don’t fill them up—when they’re not even hungry. Could there be a more obvious cause of obesity?\n\nDuring the 1980s and ’90s, the percentage of obese Americans roughly doubled.^(1) What changed? Among other things, between 1977 and 2001, US calorie intake from sugar-sweetened beverages increased by 135%.^(2)\n\n**References**\n\n1  United States, Trends 1960-1962 through 2007-2008,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

          "Lost 81 pounds in the last 11 months.  I am at a healthy BMI but working on my body composition now.  Maybe I lose, maybe I gain, but it is about body fat now. I am technically in the healthy range, but I would love to cut a little more.\n\nI was always a yo yo person, and also an all or nothing person.  I would CONSTANTLY cut out so much and if I screwed up, eat SO much garbage sometimes for the day, sometimes finishing out the week (with garbage food). It clearly wasn't the right mindset.  Now, for me, cutting out sugar really helps AT FIRST.  But what I had to really get behind was that really, there aren't any \"bad\" or \"good\" food.  There is food that is more nutritiously dense, and less so, or high calorie and low calorie, but that is about it.  I crave sugary foods too often, and it seems like when I feed that beast too often I struggle more with cravings.  So, this last time, I did cut out sugar, but I did Whole 30.  That is a 30 day elimination diet.  I have done it before, and usually feel really great, so I started there.  As the cravings diminished, it got easy for me to avoid junk food.  I have since added sugary foods in, but I try to limit myself to once a week or so.  It is probably not any different than someone else fitting them into their daily calories.  I just limit mine to weekly, as I find I usually feel better then.  \n\nOne thing I realized was that I can eat a lot.  I don't need to starve myself.  I do exercise often and I enjoy it.  \n\nOkay, I have gone off on a bit of a tangent.  I tell you all of that to tell you this.  There really isn't a right or wrong way to lose weight.  There is what works.  I highly recommend that you see what works for you.  There are things that work better for people.  By doing Whole 30 a few times, I learned that I can eat carbs, but highly processed carbs don't really sit well with me.  I can have a small amount, but limited. \n\nI would recommend adding fruits and veggies, lean proteins to your diet. Add all the stu",

          "Sugar and caffeine?  If it’s just caffeine, have you tried making your own coffee?  I do black Peet’s or Starbucks brewed strong with almond milk plus vanilla coffeemate zero.  It’s like 30 cals.  \nIf it’s sugar, I have some tips for you.  I am a sugar hound.  Just a crazy, ex alcoholic sugar hound.  So I put a bunch of controls around it.  First, I make myself always always always eat a large portion of protein with vegetables first, before eating anything sweet, even fruit.  And then if I’m going to eat something sugary I get real honest about what I will binge on, and what I won’t.\nTreats I can eat without binging:  small piece of gluten free toast with peanut butter and honey on it, dairy free frozen dessert bars, a few pieces of hard candy, chocolate covered frozen fruits (you can find them in the freezer sections of most grocery stores), gluten free muffins I get at Trader Joe’s, perfectly ripe fruits in season, etc., snacks like baked lays, there’s more….sometimes if I add bread and butter pickles to a savory sandwich or bbq sauce to grilled meat it scratches the sugar itch.  Ooh lately I have chocolate cheerios with regular almond milk omg it’s so good, 200 cals for the whole thing.\n\nTreats I cannot eat, or I’ll overeat and gain weight, and sometimes I just know this and do it anyway but I don’t lie to myself:  bags of chocolate, sugary popcorn flavors, bags of wheat based cookies and even gluten free cookies, wheat based cakes, chewy candies like jelly beans, real ice cream with dairy, sugary yogurts, bread with butter and some sort of sugary topping, etc.  \nPut some barriers between you, and your treats.  Fill up on protein ALWAYS.  Get in your vegetables ALWAYS.   With time, you’ll feel “off” eating that pizza, cheeseburger or fried thing without having a big serving of vegetables with it.  Habit building.  Get your gut bacteria on the right track by adding in what you need, always before eating that thing you want.",

I don’t know how true that is, but it does make sense. At any rate, maybe the Atkins treats they sell at Walmart and other places in the health and beauty section could help? I have had those and they’re pretty good. Maybe those would be worth a shot too? Good luck and let us all know if you find the holy Grail.",

Now I enjoy it in moderation, don’t crave it as much, and when I eat it I see it as a reward instead of as a must. Let me say though, it took a while to get to this point. Not impossible but a bumpy road.

I gave up all sugary foods and caffeine in October and I'm slowly getting back to a healthy diet. I've replaced a quick, junk food meal with a can of soup (amy's) or a small bowl of instant oatmeal. Those two changes have really helped make a difference in my overall calories. And, I can go longer on the days I've had oatmeal for a snack or for breakfast.

I had that addiction to Diet Coke, and Sonic vanilla.  I detoxed mid January.  I spent 2 weeks is such a state.  No urge to get up and do anything, no exercise and withdraw from people.  Early February, I was still at 201but I started to feel better.  It has been amazing!! Now I am losing fairly quickly.\n\nI am far enough out that a sweet treat, or some drink with artificial sweetener no longer triggers that craving that comes with addiction. I have detoxed off of alcohol (10 years) and from nicotine (35 years). Once detoxed and leveled off, I find it hard to believe that these addictions had such a hold on my life all those year.\n\nGive it a try, neither sugar nor artificial sweeteners really give our lives any added value and once you are detoxed, and your brain chemistry is back to a norm, the feeling is such a relief.\n\nBest of luck.",

          "I think the craving for sugary thing works like an addiction. When you keep eating it, your body keeps wanting it. \n\nOnce I stopped eating chocolate and other sweets and really kept at it for at least a week or two, the cravings subsided. Of course I still enjoy a piece of chocolate now and then but I don’t feel like I need it nor do I want to eat lots of it. This weekend I was at a place where they had a buffet type arrangement and I found myself craving the cup of strawberries instead of the cheesecake and chocolate caramel pie that was also there for the taking. Honestly not because I am minding my calories but because the strawberries appealed to me more. I believe it is the effect of weaning myself off sugary snacks and it’s wonderful. \n\nI’d say try not to buy any of that stuff for a week or two and see if you notice a change.

          "Also, here's one unsolicited advice about sugar addiction as you've mentioned it in the posts. I struggled a lot with the sugar and high carb food cravings when I started the weight loss. The important thing to note is that it's not \"you\" who wants the sugar, it's your brain. So fake the sweet sensation with sugar alternatives that doesn't spike your insulin as much and doesn't digest to fat. And of course, at the end of the day, you'd be better off cutting off everything sweet and refined from your diet all together, but that's not realistic and too extreme.\n\nI was eating at home for the most part when I started my weight loss, so the very first thing I did was to cut out deserts and replacing them with something that has sugar alternatives and no fat. I live outside of the US so the best one for me was Allulose. Stevia would also be great. If your sugar cravings are from desserts, something like non-fat greek yoghurt with allulose based jams, or stevia sweeteners would be really good. If your sugar cravings come from drinks, sugar alternative syrups with sparkling water or cold water should be your alternative. The key here is to keep your brain happy with the \"Sweet\"ness while keeping the body unaffected by the sugar.\n\nThen, once you get used to this, slowly get off the sugar alternatives as well. Sweet things are one of those things like cigarettes. Consuming it makes you crave more. At this point, you are now detaching yourself from relying on the sweetness to feel good. Ultimately, you will be free from craving sweet things.",

But require less frequent injections.\n\nhttps://www.drugs.com/saxenda.html\n\nIt takes away your appetite basically.",
          "I’m on saxenda (daily instead of weekly injections) and here is my unfiltered opinion…\n\nMost people who are overweight do not want to be. I tried for a long time to be body positive and accept the way I was, it never worked for me and when I started feeling physical discomfort and my weight affected my everyday life, I knew I had to do something. I tried dieting and exercising and volumetric eating to stay full but I was still hungry 24/7 and it truly drove me to despair. I went to my doctor asking for something to help control my hunger cues and/or sugar craving and she put me on saxenda. \n\nThis drug changed my life, I dropped 50 pounds in a year (still 30-40 more to go) and I genuinely missed exercising but couldn’t do it because I was in pain. I can exercise again now which has helped my weight loss. I also no longer experience hormonal problems related to my weight. \n\nI don’t tell people I’m on this medication because of the stigma around it, but thankfully I’m around people who don’t comment on other people’s bodies unless they bring it up first, which I don’t.\n\nWeight loss drugs have so much stigma but I genuinely believe that the whole “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” discipline thing to not be possible for everyone, just like not everyone is able to develop the same skill set as everyone else, I’m terrible at math but excel at other things. If CICO and working out for you, by all means go for it. It doesn’t for some, like me, who felt real emotional distress by feeling hungry all day and night, every day. \n\nI think with time, and seeing how positively it can change people’s lives, in addition to looking at the statistics for obesity rates, this medication will become more accepted. It’s kind of like the whole student loan forgiveness conversation of “I worked hard so they should too” happening with ozempic/liraglutides but eventually the hype will fade, stigma will pass and next thing we know, curvier bodies will be trending again. \n\nI think there’s peo",
          "I was in a trial study for saxenda several years ago and it was the only time I ever had any tangible weight loss. I think I may have also started a plant based diet around that time. I just remember I was having success at my weekly weigh ins.\n\nEdit: I started having nausea issues while taking it. And have had nausea issues ever since.",
          "How does Monjaro and Ozempic compare to Saxenda. \nEdit: I'm aware this is something that I need to discuss with my doctor, which I plan on doing Wednesday at my doctor's appointment. I was just looking for personal experiences. I'm currently stuck at 315. I'm just in a toss up right now between trying another medication or having weight loss surgery. I had the lap band years ago and ended up with a ton of medical issues from it, so im a bit scared to try another lol. So that's why im looking for people's experiences as well. I would like to make a more informed decision. I tried googling it already before coming here and only came across general information. \n\n\n\nI noticed when I was on Saxenda a few years ago that it just stopped working after a couple of months. I retried it recently with nonexpired left over vials and it still wasn't working outside of giving me indigestion. Does Monjaro and Ozempic work better? I have hashimotos and I am obese. During the pandemic I gained even more weight. Last year I weight trained 4 days a week with a trainer and only lost 30 lbs after a whole year. I'm just sick of being big.",
          "My insurance only covers Saxenda for me (Wegovy isn’t available in Canada yet and I don’t have T2 diabetes so I don’t qualify for Ozempic) and it has been amazing. I have struggled with my weight my entire life - I remember being 6 years old and wishing I could cut my stomach off because it was “too fat”. I have tried every diet imaginable - spent years doing CICO, compete in triathlons, you name it to live a healthy life. But I have never been able to keep weight off for more than a few months and I always end up weighing more than when I started. I know Saxenda will be something I take for the rest of my life, and I’m ok with that. It was either the meds or WLS, and the meds seem like the lower risk solution. But trust me, if I could save the money every month, not have the side effects and not have to give myself a needle every day I would do it in a heartbeat. These meds aren’t the easy solution, they are the last resort for people who have a serious medical condition.",
          "I tried Qsymia and the side effects were AWFUL. Couldn’t even last two weeks on it.   I’m starting my 4th week on Saxenda and I’m down 12 pounds with minimal side effects!   I don’t feel hungry at all and I get super full, really fast.  I’m loving it.",
          "Started Saxenda yesterday which is similar to Ozempic, working in the same way basically. Havent been able to finish a meal yet which is wild. My eyes see the food and I think, I need to eat that but I cant! So strange but hoping this continues!! Was a little dizzy yesterday and a headache today and burping but nothing that makes me think I cant stick with it. Wondering what my results will be like with just less food and little exercise. Not a huge fan of exercise 😜 I am over 50 also and weight seems to stick harder on we older people 🤪",
          "Hmm, those meds can be helpful. But only once you learned to control your weight without them. Because of course the pharma industry would love you to be \"life long\" on ozempic&co (that's their official stance - it's a life long medication to control your weight).\n\nThat's not a deal I want to enter - regarding the side effects and the really wonky mechanism behind the meds (they agonize your GLP1 receptors but at the same time make your body to increase insulin - to me this doesn't sound too healthy in the long run)\n\nSo what I did is: I lost 25kg naturally. I still have to lose roughly 15kg to get to my goal. The sane thing to do would be to take a diet break and go on maintenance for 2 to 3 months and then attack the last 15kg. But I'm too impatient for that so I got Saxenda. (yes, I know - pretty idiotic reason)\n\nI'll be taking Saxenda for 2 to 3 months max and then I stop the meds and do the maintenance phase. Currently I'm in week one of Saxenda with the initial 0.6mg dose - which really works for me. I have to force myself to eat something. \n\nBut the side effects, oh man. Sulfur burps, nausea and feeling full all the time. I'm glad I'll be doing this only for 8 weeks or so. I couldn't stomach it in the long run.\n\nSo before considering those meds really get the basics down. Calorie counting, keeping your weight stable, etc. Because contrary to pharma's marketing material this is not something you want to take for life. (Also it's fucking expensive. 300 euros/month here ... I heard in the US it can be even more expensive).",
          "thank you, but it's not covered by my insurance according to their formulary :( only wegovy, saxenda, and phentermine are covered for obesity management.",
          "I'm glad this is working for you...and also a little jealous, lol. I've been on both Saxenda and Ozempic, but both made me so nauseous (especially Saxenda) that I had to stop. With Ozempic, I don't remember feeling full so much as I wasn't as hungry, and I didn't think of food all the time. That in itself was such a relief because it allowed me the space to make better choices about what I ate. Good luck on your journey!",
          "I took Saxenda for 3 months before my gastric bypass (I would have taken it longer if I didn't have to pay out of pocket) and it was... mind-blowing. I exercised pretty regularly, I ate... relatively healthy, but I ate a LOT because I felt constantly, ravenously, deliriously hungry. I weighed and tracked my food, so I knew that I was eating a hell of a lot more than I burned, but I could not reason with the food goblin in my brain. I'd eat a filling meal with lots of protein and fiber, and be thinking about my next one almost immediately. Some nights I would be in bed in tears because I knew I had eaten enough, I knew that I had eaten a balanced diet, but I was just so. goddamn. hungry. that I couldn't sleep. \n\nAlmost immediately after starting Saxenda, I felt 'normal'. Like, I could not believe that this was what other people felt like. I'd eat breakfast... and then I would be full until I looked at the clock and realized I should probably have something for lunch. I'd eat a piece of chocolate and then put the rest of the bag back because I wasn't hungry. For the first time that I could remember, food was not 90% of the background noise in my brain. \n\nI get so irritated when people dismiss medication and surgery as 'cheating' or the 'easy' way, because yeah, for weight loss to be successful long-term, you're going to have to make some pretty big lifestyle changes... but that is a hell of a lot easier to do when you are not stuck in some sort of crisis mode. It really feels like some of the backlash I've seen against medication for mental health. Yeah, maybe people would benefit from therapy and regular exercise... but that is really fucking hard to do when you're struggling just to get out of bed every day. Long term weight loss is HARD and I think it's absolutely fantastic that there are new tools out there that are not surgery.",
          "I was on saxenda for 8 months and lost 30 lbs but switched insurance and it wouldn't cover it and I gained all the weight back",
          "As someone who has done Saxenda, went the full gambit of gastric bypass surgery (got to the 6th weigh in and decided against it), and tried things like Leto and paleo… I found that the easiest thing to do was the simplest thing. Just eating clean and moving. 90% of the food in my house is ingredient food. I have to put something together or eat weird collages of things on a plate. \n\nI have PCOS and thought Saxenda would help my insulin resistance… not sure if it did, but I lost ~15 pounds in 3 weeks being on it because I felt too sick to eat. Tried getting used to the gastric bypass diet prior to possibly having the surgery. Didn’t like it, felt too weak. I’ve regained all the weight from these and then some while feeling poor. Not the way I wanted to live.\n\nNow I do the boring thing 80-90% of the time and eat meals with high protein and some greens. Even for breakfast. I’ve finally lost some of this weight and have kept it off even when I’m not keeping up with an exercise regimen (I will get in all necessary sleep.. I work 2 jobs lol). Watched numbers closely with my endocrinologist for PCOS, and my rheumatologist for an unknown inflammation issue. Still, once you know what may be off, research and tackle it. It may be boring, but why not try it for a few months.",
          "I’ve been on Saxenda a few weeks. It absolutely blows my mind how much it changed my brain. It’s not that I never get hungry, it’s that I’m not constantly thinking about food. I can eat and feel satisfied without feeling uncomfortably full. I’ve always had to just stop myself, like restrain myself from eating more, when I knew I should be done.\n\nIt kind of made me mad to finally feel what normal people feel — I’ve never felt this way in my life — u felt like I got shortchanged. And it scares me that I don’t know how long I’ll be approved for it. I wouldn’t be shocked if the company I work for pulls the plug on covering it in 2024.",
          "My doctor is suggesting medication to help kickstart my weightloss. Anyone have experience with OZEMPIC, SAXENDA OR CONTRAVE??. Hi group! \nHope everyone is doing well. \n\nJust wondering if anyone has had experience with these 3 medications: ozempic, saxenda or contrave. \n\nMy doc is suggesting trying one along with diet and exercise... as my weight has seriously spiralled out of control over the last 3 years. I've tried different diets and my worst thing is I have extreme difficulty keeping cravings in check. I'm not diabetic... yet. I'm 37, 5'8\", 350lb. And she did say that these meds help with stabilizing blood sugar, and thus help the hormones that induce cravings. I've read up on them, and there are some aide effects... I guess as with any medication nowadays. I understand ozempic is primarily for diabetes but she mentioned that a good amount of people have had success with it for weightloss. \n\nIf anyone has had any success or failures with these meds let me know your experience! \nThank you in advance!",
          "Yeah I’m on Saxenda and I don’t GAF if anyone thinks I’m cheating (not that I tell many people). It’s a TOOL, not a magic wand. It’s a tool in my tool chest, that sits alongside CICO and my treadmill. It’s not the easy way out, it’s something that has finally helped me quiet the food noise in my head. And I don’t know how long I have with it, because insurance coverage is so weird and unpredictable with GLP-1s, and there are so many shortages, so I’m damn sure gonna use this tool to its fullest extent while I have it. \n\nAlso, going forward… you don’t have to share which meds you’re taking with your friends. I sometimes get too trusting of my friends and say too much, but they don’t really get it, because they haven’t walked in my shoes, so I’ve stopped sharing. This is your business, it’s between you and your doctor.\n\nGood luck!",
          "Full disclosure - I am on saxenda which is specifically for non diabetics who are obese. I was prescribed it because I was 101kg at 5'6 and I have two obesity related comorbidities - high cholesterol and prediabetes. \n\nI was absolutely physically and mentally miserable. I had to stop riding my horses because I am too heavy and I am at my wits end with struggling to lose weight. I have tried everything, it goes well for a while, I lose a bit and then it just comes back and then some. IMO some wires are crossed and for some reason its extremely difficult to willpower my way to CICO.\n\nI started on saxenda and I hired a dietician. The mechanism for my weight loss is quite literally CICO except saxenda takes away the faulty hunger signals and intense cravings for high sugar bullshit. I feel like I now feel hunger appropriately and it isnt a constant struggle to eat a normal amount of food. As far as Im concerned at this point I have a chronic condition that is now being managed.\n\nI feel like there is a lot of hate and a lot of judgement about those who choose to takw these drugs to assist them in weight loss or have surgery to and it really sucks that we cant support each other.",
          "I absolutely had this. I was prescribed saxenda, and then supply chain issues happened so I switched to wegovy. I love to cook and I love food. But now it feels like I can enjoy my other hobbies without the constant \"is it time for lunch yet? Do we still have those Oreos? Maybe just a little bit of ice cream...\" Kinds of thoughts. It's bizarre having that part go silent. It almost feels like the kitchen is now a grayed-out portion of a videogame map that I'm not a high enough level to enter yet.

What you described here is very similar to what I did, except I didn't even increase exercise until just a few months ago at the end of Sep 2024. Until then, I was just walking and cycling outdoors during the warmer months. In Oct, I ramped up my cardio, and at the start of Nov, I added weightlifting, which I've been doing since. So far, I've only been doing more intense cardio for 3mo and lifting for 2mo.\n\nUsing portion sizing and listening to my body re: hunger signals, I've been losing since spring 2023, but it started with mental health treatment at the start of 2023. Although I didn't have a history of disordered eating, I was finally able to get to the root of why I was overeating in the first place. I *was* an emotional eater, I just didn't realize it. But that was my personal situation/history. I learned to differentiate between emotionally-driven urges to eat, vs. physiological hunger signals. I've lost 60 lbs without tracking a single calorie or macro. I tracked in all my previous weight loss attempts, so I'm still generally aware of calorie content of foods, calorie density, TDEE, etc., but I didn't track anything this time. I still check calories of restaurant and fast food menus, though.",
          "I had an ultra-fast metabolism and ate whatever I wanted until I became a teenager and got chubby. I used to be so envious of my friend, who had a HIGH metabolism their whole life and was always ultra skinny while I kept gaining weight.\n\nWhat I realised was that losing my metabolism was a blessing. My parents and family all ate terribly, and it took me 10-plus years of failure and yo-yo dieting to learn how to balance life and eat PROPERLY, as well as the importance of movement, exercise, health and mindfulness. I'm now a healthy weight and very trim, not because of ‘luck’ but because I work my ass off and eat a delicious, balanced diet. It's all because of MY actions, which makes me proud because it was a JOURNEY and not easy.\n\nAs for my friend, their metabolism did a 180 at such a late age that they find it IMPOSSIBLE to change their eating habits. They could eat whatever they wanted their whole life with ZERO consequences. So it is now infinitely more complicated for them to change their life and habits around—while I was forced to change my habits young (even though I failed and failed, I still got back up and kept trying and learning).\n\nI see the above the same way I see Ozempic. It's natural for you to feel envious of your friend, but she is probably living in absolute fear because she knows she's only losing weight because of a drug versus her actions and discipline. All that needs to be done is small micro changes each day, and the more comfortable you feel, the easier it is to swap out processed junk for real delicious food, as well as to balance treats with healthy meals in an 80/20 ratio. I lost most of my weight by walking 10k steps a day and eating 1500 calories a day, and then I wanted to go to the gym, which I now love! But I didn't try to force everything quickly; it was tiny and patient changes.\n\nThe biggest mistake people make is wanting all their results NOW! Then, throwing tantrums and giving up at the slightest set back. We have to grow up and b",
          "Factor meals (Ik Ik, it is so expensive but ER bills are more expensive). I needed something that could get me started and keep me full. Something convenient and easy since I am so depressed these days. I will get factor on weeks that I feel unwell mentally or physically. But on weeks, I feel okay and healthy ish I will make my own meals. It is what I am doing and it is making me stick to some changes. I do have some moments where I relapse and binge a bit but I can’t eat nearly as much anymore. At most it slows down the weight loss now but no more weight gain lol. I am improving and that is what matters. \n\nI guess my growing fear for getting sick is a HUGE reason why I want to change and lose weight. I want to be as healthy as possible. Healthcare is for the wealthy in America. I want to be fit, athletic and healthy. I want to be able to run 10k’s without breaking that much of a sweat. I want to love my body and feel confident. I want to look in the mirror and said, “Wow, I worked hard and I achieved my goals. I did this. I was able to reverse my prediabetes. I am in control. I am capable of change and improving my life”. I want to be in control of my life. \n\nAlso, society treats me so badly since the weight gain. I didn’t understand in the past how weight and appearance impacts the way you are treated in society. Especially as a woman. I didn’t believe people when they told me about it in the past, but now I feel like a butt since I am now experiencing what they are. Maybe this is my karma for not believing them and understanding their struggles? I feel bad. I now understand since I am experiencing this and will have more understanding/compassion moving forward when people come to me for comfort about this in the future. And when I reach my goal weight. It sucks being overweight and society is so unkind. When obese, you are invisible. Overweight you are more visible but that isn’t exactly positive based on how you are treated. Sucks but what can you do? We are all",
          "I’m so sorry you’re struggling. If you want to take a different approach than all or nothing dieting, maybe a better first step is figuring out how you put the weight back on. Is it a coping mechanism? Binge eating? Depressive lows we’re cooking is hard & you’re eating what you can grab easily? Then look at your reasons why you want to lose weight again. \n\nLittle by little you can take steps, it doesn’t have to be overnight hardcore on track. Swap for healthier meals (jerky, nuts, hard eggs) that don’t have to be cooked. Binge eating - find something else to keep your hands & mind busy. \n\nYou don’t have to track macros from the beginning. You don’t have to step on the scale. Just choose you. If losing weight is too hard right now, that’s okay. Give yourself grace and kindness. Depression is hard, you don’t need added stress & shame on top of it. Be gentle with yourself and the rest will follow.\n\nI lost 60lbs, took 3 years of hard work, and it came back under a year. I had a surgery, then became pregnant and boom. 50lbs. It was devastating. But I’m back on track now, and you can do it when you’re ready.",

If I could talk to my 21 year old self, I’d educate him on calories, TDEE, portion sizes, and I’d stress this out: it took years to gain the weight, it’s going to take time to lose it as well, and that’s ok.

I've put on 20+ lbs during the pandemic due to sedentary life style, mild depression and super stressful life circumstances causing me to take refuge in cooking and eating. I am vegetarian, don't drink a lot and used to be a lot more active in my daily life before the pandemic occurred (more non-exercise daily activities). I've had a lot of trouble sustaining a disciplined calorie counting regimen and keep starting off and giving up after 10-12 days of effort because it's just too much daily work in the day. \n\nI also feel like my crash points are usually around : \n\n1. Period time when I gain at least 3-4 lbs undoing all my effort and it just never fully goes back down. \n\n2. If any stress event occurs in my life, I feel the discipline to maintain my diet or exercise level slipping. \n\n3. My dad who is on an extended visit cooks a lot of home-food which I don't get where I live. And I feel the need to indulge while I can get this.

I am finding weight loss after 35+ as a woman extremely hard to achieve. As someone who has never been over my normal BMI for most of my life, I'm having trouble accepting that I am stuck well above the weight I would like to be. Most of the stories I read about weight-loss on this sub are for younger people who I feel have a lot of years and energy ahead of them to rectify imbalances. Also I'm reading women experience more hormonal changes at 35+ age to contribute to weight gain. Are my assumptions wrong?\n\nI don't know if I am making excuses or if other women 35+ have successfully achieved healthy weight loss. I would love to hear from you if you have. What worked? What didn't? How did you go about accomplishing.\n\nEdit: wow. I'm hearing so many different kinds of inspiring stories. Also some real practical advice on diet and exercise. I've read the basics in the FAQ and resources section. But it's very different and much more heartening hearing from real people sharing personal stories. I'm replying to everyone who shares as fast as I can. Thank you so much for being such a kind, resourceful and supportive group.",
          "Okay okay, calm down love! Forget your past for a minute, forget the other mental health issues. Before you start doing anything you need to realise and accept that it is going to take some time to lose weight and to relearn a new healthy lifestyle. You’re gonna make mistakes, you’re gonna be sad. You’re also gonna make wins and you’re going to be very proud and happy about yourself! Now, when you have accepted this, maybe you could discuss with your doctor another way to tackle those weight issues, for example through therapy? \n\nIn the mean time, about taking a 20 minute-walk everyday? Or about having greek yoghurt with fruit for breakfast? Take it easy and find which food swaps work for you. Try to make healthy cookies, a healthy pizza and try to find satisfaction in those.

You can. You certainly *can* get to a point where you want it, but you don't want it. You, like so many others, just want to have *already had it*. You want to simply be skinny again without any of the years of restriction and focus and discipline that you'll need to claw back to normal weight.\n\nIt's very simple. You need to stop eating so much. That's it. That's all there is to it. And you're so very huge that \"so much\" is still an absolutely buttfuckton of food. To merely *sustain* your current weight you need to be eating as much daily as I eat in *three days*.\n\nYou need. To stop. Eating. So much. You need to get rid of the insanely hypercaloric poison masquerading as \"food\" that you assuredly have scattered around you. No more chips, no more cookies, no more candies. Even for the \"healthy food\" you need to eat 1/5th as much as your brain tells you to eat.\n\nPresumably you have a caregiver since you're still a minor. So they need to help you too. People don't get to 550 pounds without having a feeder in their midst. Someone is getting this food for you.

          "How do you guys transition from eating for pleasure to eating for health, or better yet eating less for weight loss?. I have struggled my whole life because I love food and I eat impulsively. I think I am kind of addicted to sugar too, I love little chocolate candies and treats.\n\n For the past two years I have been around 245 lbs which as a 6 ft broad built man doesn't look that bad on me, but I'd rather be around 200-220 lbs. Also I'm 21 for reference.\n\nI typically go to the gym 3 times a week and save for the last two weeks I have kept this up pretty consistently for the last two years (I recently moved my living situation 2 hours away and started working 42 hours a week so I haven't had a chance to get back in the gym, its coming this week tho).\n\n When I started college almost five years ago, it was the most fit I've ever been. I think it's because I had to walk all over a huge campus every day including uphill walks, and I ate exclusively at the dining hall which served healthy food that I didn't have to prep and was prepaid. Also not to mention I was extremely poor, I think I had like $40 in my checking account for most of my Freshman year. Anyways during my freshman year I dropped from the 245 that I was during most of high school to 225. I felt really good and I looked skinny, honestly.\n\nFastforwarding to the current day I'm about 270 lbs and I work at a desk job. Again I'm a big boy by default so I dont look obese but I'm way heavier than I want to be. I am pretty good at eating well while I'm at work, only maybe 1200 cals while I'm there. When I get home I usually eat fast food because I struggle to find the time to cook a nutritious dinner. I work a little more than full time and I do jiu jitsu 3-5 days a week after work so I'm out of my house 6 am to 8 pm most days. \n\nAfter dinner (typically 1400 ish calories of fast food) I usually snack on like 400-1000 calories of chocolate and/or ice cream. I don't always do this but on average I do it probably 4.5/7 days of the week. I know this is the problem and I always regret it but in the moment it just feels so natural and warranted. Almost like a reward for a hard days work.\n\nAnyways I'm just wondering if anyone has broken out of this way of thinking because I just feel like I'm so used to eating like shit in the nighttime. It doesn't help  that my mom does the exact same thing and is also extremely overweight: ultimately it's my decision to put that stuff in my body though, although it's very hard to resist.\n\nTLDR: how do you stop feasting on chocolate for the dopamine and enjoyment, and start only eating when hungry and mainly nutritious foods?\n\nThanks for reading y'all",
          "I am 43. And have lost (and gained) weight successfully throughout my 20's, 30's and 40's despite health issues and, at times, mobility issues.  \n\nFirst I would say get a check up with your GP to rule out any underlying health concerns you may have.  Next have a hard look at your mental health, and if you are able to get some support with that.  You mention depression, apathy, stress and using food as a coping mechanism - until you tackle these issues losing weight will be harder.  \n\nIt has taken me years to undo the all or nothing diet mentality and over come disordered eating. I now calories count but eat whatever I feel like (within my limit), I monitor hunger and fullness ques and try to eat with them.  I also monitor my emotions around why I might feel like eating I.e. I am not hungry I am bored, sad, angry etc.  I allow myself to eat but also examine why.  By recognising and giving myself permission to feel and eat as needed it takes the pressure off.\n\nI view calories as weekly deficit and keep my maintenance figure in mind.  I know if I have day where I eat a bit more than usual  so long as I am sitting on or around maintenance at the end of week I am good.  If I am under fabulous but if not, and all I have done is balance my eating then I am good.  It isn't a race it is a lifestyle choice.  \n\nI use a food scale and mostly cook all my meals myself.  I am single and have the luxury of doing this.  At the very least I would suggest accurately tracking as it is very easy to over eat.\n\nI aim to walk 8000 steps per day.  If I wake up and feel rubbish I aim for 5000.  If I wake up and feel great I might do more. \n\nWeight loss is ultimately calories in v calories out.  Start small, and aim to be consistent, not perfect.  Yes it takes longer but unless you change your habits it won't stick.

          "The principle of the thing is easy. Ultimately, it does boils down to that.\n\nUnfortunately, we are also complex beings, and weight is influenced by so many factors that it can be hard to get to a place where you've erased the noise enough to focus on those two things.\n\nFor me, I lost and gain a lot of weight throughout the years (mostly gain though). And in the end, it is only now that I can see myself losing the weight for good. It is going slowly, but steadily, and in a period where I am overworked and over stressed (I used to put on 2 to 3 kg per months during such times, and now I am losing 1kg per month).\n\nBut to get to that point, I had to:\n\n1) figure out what macros repartition made me feel best, when I prefer to eat (breakfast or non? Small snacks or large meals?...) how it felt when I was physiologically hungry and how psychological hunger felt\n\n2) figure out that I have PCOS, and several other deficiencies, and address those\n\n3) figure out that I have ADHD, so moderation is going to be a losing strategy, and figure out strategies to keep the balance between enjoying treats (otherwise there will be a snap and binge) and the inevitable death of any pack of food I start (which, if I am not careful shopping, can end up as a binge) \n\n4) figure out that food was the entirety of my coping mechanism (stressed? Food! Bored? Food! Uncomfortable? Food! Happy? Food!) and then develop strategies to redirect and cope differently.\n\nI could go on. I have spent the last few years sorting those out, and now I feel I am able to really get to the diet and exercise to lose weight part of the process.\n\nOP seems to have been lucky and skipped a few of those preliminary steps, but it's okay to take the time to sort out the other stuff before. \n\nWe are human, and we have only some available bandwidth to work with. Life happens. Maybe you need to learn what your body prefers first. Maybe you need to sort out psychological issues. Failures provide useful feedback and information.",

And I'll tell you why right now, because you have one thing that no one can take from you or change- you don't want to go back there.\n\nEvery day, just do a little more.  Take a watch and record how long you last/ how far you make it.  Over time, you'll see it will add up.\n\nMake simple changes to your diet.  You're in a position where even making small changes will have a large effect on you.  Give up soda.  Skip your morning snack.  Drink more water.  Pick any one thing and go from there. Don't do all of those things at the same time, but pick something and just start.  It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be done.  \n\nGet therapy.  If nothing else, read a few books about your relationship with food.  I've heard great things about Brain over Binge.  I'm sure there are other books out there which will relate to your circumstances.\n\nKeep a food diary.  Write down what you eat, when you eat and what your emotions were when you ate it.\n\nYou got this.  You can do it.  I believe in you.",

College was a slow weight gain experience that just steadily got worse as I got older.

I recommend cooking as many meals as possible from home.  Learn to cook if you don’t know how.  Read up on the Mediterranean Diet.  You don’t have to eat that way exclusively - far from it.  However I think resources for this diet will teach you about nutrition and generally how to build complete meals.  \n\nGood for you to not waste as much time as I did!",
          "What are you doing?  I mean, are you severely limiting your calories or what you allow yourself to eat?  \n\nLosing a bunch of weight at first can be highly motivating, but the best way to lose weight and keep it off is slowly.  I HATED to hear this when I was obese.  I just wanted to lose weight as fast as possible.  Then I would constantly gain weight back, and then some.  When I started losing the last time I shifted a lot of my focus.  I changed it from losing weight to being healthy.  My dad had passed and I didn't want illnesses to take me out.  I wanted to enjoy playing with my kids, and being active.  While I hoped that I would lose weight, I decided that I needed to eat healthy foods and exercise. By no means did I want to make this a fad.  I did cut out a lot of junk foods at first (sugary foods were my weakness) I knew that it wasn't permanent.  I knew that I would eventually eat and enjoy those things in moderation, but I never wanted to eat the way I had been.  I was eating a LOT of food, but nothing of good quality.  EVERYTHING changed when I did that.  I did lose weight, but it was such a difference when I focused on my health.  If I wasn't seeing results, I focused on the fact that I was more flexible, getting stronger, etc., and then I went down a size.  then I was stronger... then down a size, I had more endurance, and then went down a size.  It took time.  A LONG time.  And it was worth it.  I focus on different things more, I focus on my health and what fuels my body better than what I am eating. \n\nI am NOT saying that this will work for you.  But taking your time will help you because you can just cut out 1 or two things (or cut back) and add in activity, or add in more veg... and it will help.  Small, sustainable changes make the difference.",
          "My somewhat unpopular opinion: if you’re thinking of food every single hour, it’s a sign from your body that it’s time to stop and reassess. Even if that means going back to old habits for a while, NOTHING good follows the huge red flag that is food obsession. \n\nStop counting calories. Stop weighing yourself. Eat some meals with someone you love and try to focus on the conversation and not the food. \n\nThen when you feel connected to your body again, take stock of yourself and your goals. If you’ve recently gone to a physical where your doctor told you losing weight is paramount, perhaps make weight loss a priority. If it’s purely aesthetic, focus on working on self-acceptance and becoming body neutral first. Discuss your past relationship with food with a registered dietician or therapist. \n\nIf you still want to lose weight, be patient with yourself and lose at a steady pace. It may take you years to get to your goal weight but you’ll be fine until then. Truly. No one is looking at you and thinking the harsh things you may think about yourself. In 20 years you’ll look back on photos of yourself at the weight and age you are now and be happy you have those memories. \n\nWeight loss from a place of self-hate and judgement is chaos. You’ll always be in a happiness deficit because your “good” days will never make you feel as good as your “bad” days make you feel like shit. \n\nGood luck! I know this is hard.",

Because I have been you my entire life, I am now 42 and after 3 years of hard inner work I am finally in a place to start slowly losing weight whilst focusing on health.

If you are not tracking correctly then it is understandable but if you are tracking every single thing you eat (which from the comments you seem to be) then there could be a medical issues that needs addressing.  Not feeling full/hunger can be mental but can also be hormones and other physiological issues.  A referral to endocrinology might help.  Your GP can also refer you for MH support around food and disoreded eating.  \n\nI understand your frustration and the need to \"let someone else do the work\" in regards to food prep bur in doing so you are not teaching yourself how to manage food, simply replacing one problem with a other.

But it might help you to stop the sweets.",
          "Tried that approach years ago, a big breakfast for me only lead to more hunger daily and it's literally impossible to stay in decicit by the end of it. Breakfast might be the only thing that's always worked for me, when I was at my ideal weight included. I usually have oatmeal and bunch of fruit, and I mean a lot of fruit. Blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, an apple, half a banana etc. I make a huge bowl so I feel full until at least 1-2 pm. Sometimes I make a fruit salad with greek yogurt and cinnamon, something like that. Eggs and bacon puts me directly back to sleep 🤣",
          "The only time I go 10 - 12 hours without food is when I’m asleep. Then I wake up and have breakfast.

Personally I’m not used to eating after my main meal in the evening, but you could also have a snack a couple of hours before bed if needed.

I changed some eating habits: always eat a piece of fruit/veggies with every meal, eat them first, then protein, then the carbs, BUT DO EAT THE CARBS! I tended to overindulge so I just ate them last so I’d already be closer to being full. Stop when you’re comfortable though. When I ate something, I put it in a bowl. Want chips? Okay. Not straight out of the bag. Want ice cream or candy or popcorn or crackers? In a bowl. Helps you with portion control. And the most, most helpful thing, stop going out to eat!

          "Getting enough protein!. Tl;dr: getting enough protein on 1600 calories is hard!!\n5'8\" 195lbs\nHi! I've had a very hard time losing my pregnancy weight (from 6 years ago lol). I never had any issues with weight before but in retrospect, I was 21 or less, working 60 hours a week on my feet, and didn't have time to eat 3 meals a day. I gained 50 pounds in the last 2 months of pregnancy and had a voracious appetite from breastfeeding and 4 months PP weighed as much as I did the day I gave birth. That's when I started working out and trying diets. I don't eat red meat. Keto just made me really hangry, IF is something I naturally do already because I'm not a breakfast person, CICO works fine for me but doesn't actually make me lose weight, I even tried Ozempic and only lost 2 pounds after 2 months of eating like... so few calories a day I was starting to pass out. My thyroid is fine, my hormones are fine, I think my metabolism just really sucks unless I'm SUPER active. My lifestyle now is fairly sedentary; i WFH so Im up and down a lot throughout the day but at a desk for several hours. I do garden and weight lift 4x a week and recently started running which I do think has helped me lose a couple pounds. All that being said, my BMR is 1750 calories a day. Even if exercising i do tend to eat right around that, so the math really doesn't make sense. Sure, there are some days that I eat 2000 calories, and some days I eat 1300. But i just don't have that big of an appetite. Anyway, i really struggle with eating enough protein, especially since i dont eat meat (i do eat chicken and seafood). Even if I focus on protein for every meal, I just don't eat enough calories to get the 175g I'm aiming for every day. I do think this is important because I lift pretty heavy at the gym and I have a lot of muscle (under layers of fat... 🙄). Any tips?? *i should also add i cook 95% of my meals at home and tend to eat pretty healthy. ",
          "Last April, at 37, I went to my 2-year post-cancer screening.

I was looking at 40 in a few years and I made it a promise that I wouldn't be 300lbs at 40 years old...\n\nI started slowly. I've never been one to count calories, but what I did was prioritize getting protein. I shot for .6g per lb of goal body weight (i.e. 135g for a goal weight of 225). I wanted to make sure that I hit that goal every day. I'm not big on supplements and the like, so I'm doing that by eating whole foods (chicken breast, ground beef, Greek yogurt, etc.) I found that by reaching that goal daily that I had far fewer hunger pangs than when I was more carb-heavy in my dietary choices.\n\nI also started walking. A LOT. Started going for 20 minutes a day. Then 30. Then 45. Once I could routinely go for 45 minutes every day I concentrated on improving my speed. I started jogging twice a week.

I think its just mental fatigue from being so restrictive for so long. My thought was that I could raise my maintence calories slightly, and maybe buffer some of the damage I've been doing with the ocasional binge!

Everyone suggested to me I wasn't consuming enough protein, and jokes on me, they were right! \n\nI thought \"Ohhh, I eat eggs and cottage cheese. I'm fine! That's not the problem!\" Not even realizing how much the active human body ACTUALLY needs. I've started drinking shakes and eating protein bars as a snack and I am HARDLY EVER hungry! It's wild. The more I prioritize it, the easier it is to stay within my defecit because I always feel so satisfied! I feel silly just now coming to this realization, but protein is MAGIC, and if anyone else is struggling with staying within their defecit, maybe you also aren't consuming as much as you need!

I've tried sticking to protein shakes for breakfast, consuming more water (minimum 80-90oz a day), and eating more fruits and vegetables but I'll admit I'm more than likely doing something wrong.",
          "So I'm a cancer survivor and the last 10 months have gained a lot of weight from high dose steroids I needed after treatment. I saw an RD at my cancer center, and despite me telling her the specifics of what was going on, she wanted to do the \"make small changes\" approach. She wanted me to pick a single goal and work on it. I chose eating more veggies. While it helped, it wasn't helping the situation I was in. \n\nIn hindsight I felt like she wanted to teach me things I already knew, not what I wanted. And while her approach I'm sure is successful, I didn't need an RD to do it. Instead now I do it on my own, set goals and make small changes. If you already know how to cook then you have a huge advantage! Calorie counting is a very successful option.",
          "Here's the thing. I didn't say, \"I'm going to eat this and cut out that.\" I had a daily calorie target. As long as I hit that target, I could eat whatever I pleased. But this forced me to evaluate what foods would serve my goal. Certain things got squeezed out. Like, I pretty much quit drinking because of the empty calories.\n\nAs I lost weight, the calorie target had to be revised downward. I added half a pound of plain chicken to my diet because it would really fill me up for only 270 calories, giving me more wiggle room for the rest of the day. And so it goes. If I couldn't hit my target because I was too hungry, I had to change what I ate so I wouldn't be so hungry. In this way, my diet gradually changed.",
          "41 F and 5’5 here. I’ve lost 17 lbs since December. What has worked for me is a consistent exercise routine (orangetheory), staying at 1700-ish calories per day (but not beating myself up if I go over) and 100+ grams of protein every day. The last one may be harder for you as a vegetarian, but I recommend the high protein super firm tofu, Greek or Icelandic yogurt (15g protein per serving) and orgain protein powder. Oh and the simply protein bars from Costco. And eggs if you eat them. \n\nMy nutritionist was impressed at my last appointment because I’ve lost fat but gained muscle thanks to the exercise and protein. She asked how I make the exercise a priority with a full time job and 2 yr old, and I told her it’s because I started out doing it for my mental health and not to lose weight. I also have a supportive husband, a workout buddy (my bestie) to hold me accountable and I like seeing progress on trackable things like a timed one mile run on the treadmill. And I just like it! \n\nI still have a ways to go (CW 187, SW 204, GW 135), but I’m cool with slow and steady. I have more energy to keep up with my kiddo and do intense tasks like long days of yardwork. It makes a difference!",
          "I’m 5’7 and started at 38 after a doctors appointment that said i was hitting pre-diabetic sugar levels. I lost 75 points (215-140) in a little over a year. I am also a vegetarian like you. So the getting protein was a challenge for me. \n\nHere are my changes that helped: \n1. Intermittent Fasting: my eating schedule is 12pm to 9pm. Most often, my first meal is around 4ish when I get off work. I drink coffee and teas until that time. Randomly, like maybe less than 20 times over the last 2 years, am I hungry before 2pm.\n1. Weight lifting. I was always into cardio but going to weight lifting just made me lose a ton of weight after I got pass the initial shock of muscle tears.. I happened to experience that swoosh thing some beginning weight lose/strength training people talk about. \n1. Replace cheese with cottage cheese.  As a vegetarian, I leaned hard on cheeses and that was a mistake.  Now I only eat cottage cheese and binge of veggies. \n\nGood luck!!!",
          "Loose skin, stretch marks and dealing with dissatisfaction with results.. Hey cutie patootie, need some knowledge and advice bestowed upon me. \n\nI'm 23M 5'11, started my weight loss journey at 240 lb/110kg when my doctor diagnosed me with prediabetes and gave me Ozempic. Took Ozempic for 3 months and started lifting, now I'm at 6 months later and close(er) to my final goal rn at 77kg/170lbs, so 70lbs or 32kgs of fat loss. I'm going off how I look visually so no specific weight goal. \n\nI've basically spent a lot of time focusing on weight loss and getting leaner, I realised I haven't looked into how my body would actually look like after, not just the idealized cute hunky twunk with blonde hair and blue eyes (I'm neither blonde nor blue eyed yet, I demand a refund!). \n\nI'm completely covered with stretch marks due to rapid weight gain from shoulders to thighs, and while I don't mind *too* much, will they fade? And if so, how long would it take?\n\nI'm completely unfamiliar with loose skin as well, is that something to be expected with 70lbs of weight loss? I'm not sure how to identify it, and how long will it take for shrinkflation to affect my skin and get it back to normal. \n\nFinally, does anyone else just look down and still see a big belly and thick thighs? Other people have noticed a difference and when I look in the mirror, it does look like a little excess chub but when I look down, it looks very similar to the belly I've had for all my life, which is daunting and disappointing since despite my progress, I can't tell how much more weight I'd need to lose until I'll be happy with how I look.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated, including tips on how to deal with stretch marks and your personal experience dealing with these issues, either successfully or unsuccessfully.

          "I am an active person, 10k steps just at my work, plus running or hiking 3 times a week. I eat healthy (lots of vegetables). I also eat/ate a lot of junk on top of eating healthy. I've tried all the diets, and while they work for a time, they aren't sustainable. I've done therapy. I finally was talking to a nutritionist, who was telling me stuff I already knew. The life changing moment for me happened when she said \"Ok, let's talk about protein\". I told her I needed about 80g a day,  currently getting around 60g a day (I eat mostly vegetarian), and that I'd consumed about 20g so far with another anticipated 45g by the end of the day based on what i had planned for lunch and dinner. She wanted to input the data, just to be sure. I was bang on. It's not a lack of knowledge for me. It's that I feel like I have about 6 people constantly shouting at me about food, and the only time they shut up is when I'm eating. So she suggested Ozempic. I started it in November, and stayed on the lowest dose for the longest time. I am now on an approx dose of 37.5. I'm not diabetic, so I'm trying to not use more than that because of the shortages I hear about, and also any higher doses don't seem to offer any extra benefit. But holy has it made a difference. I noticed it within 24hrs of my first dose. It's like when you're in a forest, and all the birds go silent. I pay $260 CAD every 6 weeks (it's not not covered by my insurance). It's worth every penny, and I would be happy to stay on it for the rest of my life, even if just for the mental benefit alone. I'm 5'6, and have gone from 223 lbs to 185 lbs, and honestly it seems effortless. Previous dieting I'd get really cold, and lethargic, and have no energy to do anything. It's like my thermostat was set wrong. Also whenever I ate, I felt like a bogged down engine, like I needed a bit of sugar to help the engine to run faster (I didn't eat the extra sugar, it's just that that's that response that I felt I was needing).

          "Two months of working out and eating better, but gain weight, measurements have increased.. 39F, just started working out beginning of January (not a new years resolution thing, just coincidental). At \\~195-197lbs, hadn't worked out in a few years due to car accident and surgery, but had been really in shape, super active, 170lbs and I was pretty happy with the muscle and tone I had. I got up to nearly 210, started trying Ozempic, but too expensive, didn't seem to do anything for me aside from yes, helping me lose maybe 10lbs over 6 months.\n\nBecause I'm also testing the waters as I see what my ankle can do, I know I've still been limited and slow with testing what workouts I can do. I know I can still be better at eating and consistently tracking calories. Been doing lots of spin classes, as I always liked those in the past and they've been favorable to my ankle. Started getting into some HIIT type classes this past week, seeing how they go with the ankle. I use the MyFitnessPal app for tracking, has me at 1600 calories a day and adjusts for the workouts. It's been very hard to stick to this, I'm always hungry.\n\nAfter two months of eating better and being active, I'm really disappointed that I've gained a few pounds, measurements have slightly gone up, I feel flabbier, and clothes fitting tighter. I know I'm not 30 anymore, because this same effort 10 years ago would have likely resulted in a 10-15lb loss by now. I've started testing blood sugar at home, as I've had some periodic episodes of 'feeling low blood sugar', but everything has been ok. Nothing 'low', but on the lower side if I have carb light meals. Did an A1C test today and it's 5.1%, so there's no real concern for diabetes. I need to get in and see about thyroid testing too, plus whatever else to look at.\n\nReally feels defeating. It seems like too long of a plateau, if that's the case, and if I'm about to start seeing progress finally.",
          "I don’t know how to eat clean and exercise every day. The moment I eat a bit more I regain the weight I lost plus more. I don’t know if anyone else feels this way, but I feel like I have to eat clean and exercise every single day just to maintain my weight. If I don’t, I gain weight almost instantly, even within two days. It’s incredibly frustrating.\n\nFor example, let’s say I start at 110kg. I can work hard to lose 1kg, but then, after just a couple of days of eating slightly over my usual intake (not even bingeing, just a little over my diet), I’ll gain that kilo right back. At first, I assume it’s just water weight, but it never seems to go away. It feels like no matter what I do, my body is constantly working against me, and I’ve been stuck in this cycle for so long.\n\nI’ve been wondering if I should consider Ozempic. Has anyone had success with it? I know this might sound like I’m just not tracking properly, but I genuinely log everything I eat. I’ve even worked with a personal trainer before. Exercise is something I enjoy, but in terms of weight loss, it doesn’t seem to make a difference for me. The only thing that really helps is strict calorie counting. But the moment I go out for a meal with friends and exceed my daily limit.. by even 300 calories, my body seems to store it instantly, as if it never forgets.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? What did you do? For context, I also have PCOS, so I suspect that might be a factor in why it’s so ridiculously hard to lose weight.\n",
          "I am 72 & have lost 63 pounds over the past 2 years. My wake up call was having emergency surgery. It was horrible trying to recover but it gave me insight to what my life would be like if I didn’t get in better shape. So I started going to the gym first thing every morning. I would walk 15 minutes on the treadmill every day. Slowly I increased my time & speed. Didn’t lose anything. So I recorded my food intake, noting the calories, carbohydrates & fats for 6 weeks. I took this to an endocrinologist & was prescribed Ozempic. Taking this along with the exercise has made the difference. I plateaued a lot. Each pound has been a struggle. However I can walk up stairs without too much trouble and I can get up & down on the floor.",
          "Bulk or keep losing?. So I was on ozempic lost 40lbs in 2-3 months after working hard on my mental health. I have a decent amount of loose skin. I've been finding the way I lose quick is to eat in a deficit and then once I slow down eat in a surplus for 1-3 weeks. I was losing about 15 lbs month on and two and about 5 the last month. With very little to no exercise. Now I can't take the ozempic. I was thinking about going on daily runs, eating in a surplus and lifting weights bc I know on ozempic sometimes I barely eat. I was thinking maybe doing this routine for lil 1-3 months since I have lost a large amount of weight already for reference I'm 5’4 SW:284 CW:244 goal: 140",
          "Finally, feel like I'm on track (using Ozempic). I have struggled with my weight since I was 19, tomorrow I turn 36. At my heaviest, I was 140kg (approx 310lb) which was about 2 years ago and so far am down 15kg (33lb), I'm only 5'7 so my goal weight is really about 80kg (175lb). My weight has yoyoed over the years but has been gradually creeping. 2021 was the first year that I can remember where I ended less than I started, but it has been a massive struggle until recently. \n\nAfter working with my Dr over the past few years around this, she recommended I try Ozempic to get my weight loss moving along as by that stage I had lost around 7kg (15lb). This was in mid-December 2021. Since then (2 months) I've lost a further 8kg and am feeling great! The biggest thing for me is that it actually takes very little willpower (arguably none) as I just can't eat much. My portion sizes have gone down 75% from what they used to be and I'm rarely hungry. I feel like how I think normal people do with food where you eat and then at a point get full and not constantly craving more and serving sizes being so much larger than other people.\n\nAt one stage I felt like I was cheating my weight loss journey, but this isn't a competition I'm trying to win, this is about my health and I don't want to be in a constant battle with food. I love food and don't want to feel guilty every time I sit down to eat and constantly fight with my appetite when I diet which destroys my willpower.\n\nI'm not suggesting this medication or any medication to others, but it sure is working well for me and I finally believe that I will be able to get down to my goal weight again and I can't wait to see my scale to drop below 100kg (220lb) for the first time in about 8 years.",
          "Ozempic 5 month update: I feel like I was playing on hard mode and now I've got cheat codes.. So this week marks 5 months since I started Ozempic (not a sponsor - I feel like a bad advertisement every time I mention their name) at 233 pounds.  I posted my first week results and thoughts [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/toy24j/is_this_how_normal_people_feel_after_eating_aka_i/)  I took my 22nd (I think) shot yesterday, and crossed over the boundary into the category of Overweight, down from Class 2 Obese, which also puts me half way to my goal of getting under 150, so I thought it was a good time for an update.\n\nMe:\n\nI'm a 44f, 5'7, started at 233 pounds (high weight was 267.4 about 4 years ago). Goal weight 150ish.  I've never gotten below 167.6 as an adult.  I have PCOS, hypothyroid, insulin resistance, and leptin resistance.  So losing weight has always been on hard mode, as I'm kind of a worst case scenario for  weight control.  I lost 100 pounds about 4 years ago, but I had to make it the focus of my entire life, and as soon as I got distracted, I gained 65 of it back, mostly in the early months of the pandemic.\n\nI'm going to start out by saying if you only need to lose a few pounds or if you aren't already eating right and exercising, and all you need to do to lose weight is cut the soda and/or alcohol, or whatever, then Ozempic probably isn't going to help you and you should probably just skip reading this post.  I suspect some of the comments I got in my last post were from people who wanted a quick fix to take 20 pounds off for swimsuit season, and that isn't what Ozempic is.  If you don't have hormonal issues, like Leptin resistance, it probably won't help you lose weight, because there is nothing to correct.  But if you are already doing all the right things, and are chronically obese, and are always hungry, you might talk to your doctor to see if the benefits would outweight the risks for you.  I'm not advocating it for anyone, but it has been an amazing tool for me. \n\nEffectiveness:\n\nI've lost 42 pounds so far (about 18% of my starting weight) in 21 weeks, so right on 2 pounds per week average.  Of course, it hasn't been that linear.  I lost over 8 pounds the first week, and I've had a few weeks I gained weight, but my average overall has been right on 2 pounds per week.  Which is fantastic.  I'm also only on .5 dose (which is the low end), so I can increase still if the effectiveness lessens.  Most people don't lose weight until they reach a higher dose than this, so I consider myself very lucky.\n\nI have very little appetite the first few days after my injection, followed by a few days of what I feel like is normal appetite, followed by a day or two of progressively more hungry until it is time for my next shot.  I'm not actually counting calories right now, just focusing on eating healthy foods.  On days I'm not very hungry, I make sure to at least get a protein shake, a salad, some fruit, some nuts ... something nutritious a few times a day.  Small meals fill me up quickly.\n\nI had blood work drawn a couple months ago.  My numbers weren't terrible to start with, but they almost all showed at least minor improvement, much of which was probably due to the weight loss as much as anything.  I'll get bloodwork done again next month.\n\nSide Effects:\n\nThe first week, I mostly burped a lot.  After a few weeks, I had some GI effects (more diarrhea than constipation overall). More fiber helped with that, and it mostly went away.  I have had a bit of nausea now and then.  I have to eat less food than before or I get queasy, but so far, I haven't found any food I can't tolerate at all.  Some, especially greasy foods like pizza, I have to stick to very small portions, but I have figured out that I can have a slice, no problem.  (Considering I don't have a gallbladder either, I consider myself pretty lucky to be able to eat greasy foods in any quantity at all.)  But the side effects overall haven't been anything I couldn't handle.  I still feel like the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nAvailability and costs:\n\nThis has been my biggest concern.  Over and over again, I hear of massive shortages of this medication, and how some countries can't even get it right now at all, and many doctors won't prescribe it right now to new patients due to the shortage.  So far, my pharmacy hasn't had any difficulty getting it, for which I am grateful.  My insurance made me pay $250 copay for the first pen, but each pen after that has only been $25.  I didn't end up even needing the coupon that several people helpfully mentioned in my last thread.\n\nOther thoughts: \n\nThe hardest thing for me on this journey is that I don't see the weight loss. I know that is a common complaint and many people say they can only see it in photos.  But I took photos at 233, 213 and now a few days ago at 193, and I just can't see much of any difference even in the photos.  I'm one of those people who loses weight from EVERYWHERE at once (ankles, shins, fingers, toes - I even lost weight inside my ear canals and ended up with a weird hearing problem temporarily a few years ago), so the 40 pound loss just looks like you let a little bit of air out of me, since it is so spread out.  I'm down 3 pants sizes, but I just can't see it much, even in the photos.  I'm really looking forward to the next 20 pounds, because I'm at the point where I started to see the changes last time.\n\nThe biggest revelation for me in this journey has been the feeling of satiation.  Other than the day before my weekly shot, I rarely feel actually hungry these days.  I feel like I'm cheating, because this feels like losing weight on easy mode.  Sure, there are some side effects, but they are easier to put up with than the constant gnawing hunger that came with even eating at maintenance before.  I'm eating a lot less and feeling full instead of starving.  I also have more energy now that my brain is getting the signal from my leptin - that's one of the things Ozempic does is increase leptin sensitivity - so when my body says \"hey, plenty of fat down here, go ahead and burn some off\", my brain can actually hear it now.\n\nFAQ from my last post:\n\n1. My general PCP prescribed it.  But with the shortages right now, many doctors aren't prescribing it to new patients. I don't have advice to help you get it prescribed.  Talk to your doctor about one of the other GLP1 Agonists, or wait for the supply to increase.\n2. My insurance covered it, at least after my first fill.  It is FDA approved for diabetes control.  I'm not diabetic, but I've been prediabetic more than once, and at least once, got very close to the diabetic line.  It has been a battle to stay on this side of that line.  If your insurance won't cover it, and your doctor thinks it could help you, possibly ask them about one of the other drugs in the same class (GLP1 Agonists).  Wegovy and I think Saxenda are FDA approved for just weight loss.  If your insurance won't cover it, it is prohibitively expensive.  \n3. Since the issues that led to my obesity are chronic (PCOS, hypothyroid, insulin resistance, leptin resistance), I expect to be on this for a while.  Possibly I will need to stay on a maintenance dose forever.  We'll see.  It is also possible that if I maintain a lower body weight for a while, my leptin resistance will correct, and I can go off the meds and maintain the loss. \n\nAfter decades of fighting against my body to lose weight, I finally feel like my body and I are on this journey together, for the first time.  Here's to the next 40 pounds.",
          "Feeling extremely insecure over the meal plan my nutritionist has given me.. Hey guys! I've been a lurker for a while on this sub, mainly to read other's perspectives/experiences on weight loss, since I haven't received any straightforward directions or advice from any medical professionals I have gone so far. I know Reddit isn't really the place for reliable information, but I just feel like I need the opinion of people who have no idea who I am to see if I am going crazy or if my concerns have any merit. I apologize for any grammar mistakes, as I'm not a native English speaker.\n\nFor context: I'm a 19yo, 163cm/5'4\" woman, and I'm currently weighing 160lb/72.9kg. I also have 27% body fat and I believe around 22% lean mass. \n\nI've had a history of heavy binge eating that started just after entering puberty. I was heavily obese and, during the pandemic (16 years old) I weighed around 216lb/98kg. I started portioning my meals, without counting calories, and managed to lose some weight. Then, I was prescribed Ozempic to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. I used the medication consistently for about a year, then stopped, reaching my lowest weight ever of around 158lb/72kg. Six months later, I went back up to 176lb/80kg, then started going to the gym. Then, I started counting calories and haven't stopped since. That was in September last year, and I'm still counting everything I eat. Which brought me nearly back to my lowest weight (160lb/72.9kg).\n\nEven with good progress (55lb lost in the span of 2 years) All I know about my nutrition is built on Google searches and calorie calculators, so I felt like I needed a professional so I didn't need to think too hard about my choices. I went to a nutritionist Friday, then Monday he gave me the following meal plan:\n\nBREAKFAST: 2 Eggs, 1 loaf of whole bread (50g), and 1 \"unit\" of banana (30g??)  \nSNACK: 1 unit of banana (30g)  \nLUNCH: 1 fillet of chicken without skin (120g), white rice (75g), veggies (50g??), salad (135g???)  \nSNACK: 1 serving of rolled oats (21g), 1 container of fat-free Greek yoghurt (90g), 5 strawberries (100g), 1/2 scoop of isolated whey protein (15g)  \nDINNER: 1 fillet of chicken without skin (120g), white rice (75g), salad (135g???)  \nSNACK: 1/2 cup of milk (120ml), 1 unit of banana (30g), 1/2 scoop of isolated whey protein (15g)\n\nGuys... I put that in my app, and this amounts to 1200kcal (give or take 60kcal with the oil that can be used to grill things)\n\nHe SAID my maintenance – my BMR, so coma-maintenance – was at around 1375kcal (which I can't help but doubt), then proceeded to give me a diet with a value that went *below that***.** Am I crazy for not wanting to go through this? To not want to portion a goddamn *banana* into thirds so I can have a piece of it at different times? I tried to readjust the chicken by putting in cooked weight instead of raw, but that just changed it to 1300kcal, give or take oil calories, so my *BMR*. \n\nFor further context: As the counting progresses, the weight loss gets slower. I've tried readjusting my calorie intake to make it faster (went around 1200kcal/day), but went overboard for two weeks and started developing anorexic patterns of thinking (liking the feeling of hunger) until I had an emotional breakdown (along with dizzy spells, hair breakage, irritability, anxiety, weakness, the whole package) and upped my calories a little. I've had episodes of eating more than I should, then purging it later if I felt like the damage was too big (300kcal extra).  \n  \nI told that to my nutritionist, told him how badly eating that low affected me mentally and physically. He sent me this meal plan, and I tried reiterating it to him, but he just said to \"drink more water\".  \n  \nI don't think I'm crazy when I think this will not be doable or sustainable, and will only make me sick. But at same time, he's the doctor, so what good does it do if I don't trust his word. Soon, I'm going back to university, and I won't have time to go to the doctor again because I got to another city that my plan doesn't cover, and I don't think it's worth sacrificing my academic progress to just test out doctors to get a second, thrid, fourth opinion. There's a part of me that is also scared that diet is the way I'll have to eat for the rest of my life and, ya'll... I've been going to therapy for 5+ years, and it's been better, but I don't think there will ever be a time I'd be okay with that. \n\n(TLDR: Aim I crazy for not wanting to follow the 1200kcal meal plan my nutritionist gave me, despite him knowing it's below my BMR and knowing my history of disordered eating?)",
          "190 pounds. It took me 4 grueling years but it was worth it and I have finally achieved my goal:I am officially skinny. \n\nIf I had to use specific percentages,I have lost approximately 53,5% of my entire body weight,with my BMI more than halving from 43.2 to 20.1.\n\nBeginning:29M,6'4\" 355 lbs\n\nNow:33M,6'4\" 165 lbs\n\nI did intermittent fasting and cut my calorie intake down to only 2000 calories,contrasting my previous one of over 5000. This improved not only my weight problem but also made me feel happier and more comfortable with myself in general. Also did cardio very often because I know cardio helps make you skinny,as well as sometimes spending entire days not eating at all:I think at some point during those 4 years I only ate 6 days a week for 5 months straight,although later on I decided to be a bit less strict again and just continued eating daily but minimizing the amount of calories.\n\nAlso,although it might be seen as controversial,I will openly say that I personally did use Ozempic and in my case it definitely did help. I think it's best I be honest about it but nonetheless I think in my situation using it was worth it.\n\nI also did cardio regularly as recommended by my doctor,I started running,cycling,etc,... in my spare time.\n\n\n\n\nAnd now 4 years later,it has taken me all this grueling time to FINALLY drop all that weight and then some,so now I'm unrecognizable:I'm thin as a rail now,the very last thing you'd think when you look at me now (from 6'4\" 355 to 6'4\" 165) is 'fat',pencil thin would be your first thought if anything.\n\nThis makes me feel so proud and I was thinking it'd be nice to share with you all to hopefully motivate others who are struggling and to know that EVERYONE can become skinny if they have the willpower to do what's necessary for it.\n\nI do have a lot of excess skin now though,which is to be expected,hopefully I'll get approved for skin removal surgery as soon as I can.\n\nJust wanted to share my progress and,if anyone needs some advice from me,I'm happy to help.

I've been taking it regularly for the past year and a half or so,unsure if I plan to continue using it in the future but I'll see how things turn out in the long term and then decide further decisions.\n\n2. Unsure how to explain it fully,but in essence if I had to I'd say I just got sick and tired of feeling so unhealthy and unsatisfied with my physical appearance all the time and realized that all risks were worth it if getting skinny was the end result,and I would personally say everything I did no matter what was a price worth paying. I just thought to myself all the time:'being fat is hard,becoming thin is hard. Choose your hard' if you will.",
          "Right now, I’m eating anywhere between 1,200 to 1,700 calories a day. I know that’s considered low for the average person and technically still a deficit, but because I was on Ozempic for so long and eating very little, I’m wondering if this is actually a surplus for me now?\n\nI’d say I’m pretty active: I weight train 5–6 times a week and do at least 30 minutes of cardio every day. My biggest fear is gaining weight specifically around my stomach. What’s confusing is that my abs are starting to look more defined, but my lower stomach just feels like a soft blob. It’s messing with my head.",
          "Finally no longer Obese! Friends who are also overweight or obese keep telling me I don’t need to lose more :/. I’ve been on a long journey for about 2-3 years. I’m 5’3” and have lost 64 pounds so far sw 225 cw 161!  Gw I haven’t decided but between 125 and 135 I think.\n\nI started losing in 2020 when I was getting chest pains used Noom it helped a lot got from 225-178 then kinda stalled out. \n\nThis February I re-startd medication (very low dose) for adhd (diagnosed at 7 years old and took it from 10 years to about 28). I didn’t expect weight loss I wanted help with my symptoms. \n\nHowever it helped so much with curbing my appetite and getting me focused on weight loss again. I went from 178 to 161 today \n\nI did recently start compounded ozempic and am super excited. Since having kids I couldn’t ever get below 168. Before having kids I was usually 120-145 at the most. Did crash diets as a teen and at one point weighed 113 which was much too thin I looked gaunt. I’ve lost quickly on the ozempic. I lost the weight that got me under my “set weight” of 168 finally while on the starter dose (compounded and prescribed by a doctor) \n\nWell a couple of my friends, one who has lost some weight on ozempic for medical reasons and supports my use of it to be healthier and in shape recently said I’ve lost too much and don’t need to lose anymore. Another friend I was showing her pictures of myself when I was 128 pounds and she was like yuck you looked anorexic. 🙃\n\nI live in a state that has one of the highest rates of obesity. It’s rare to see someone who isn’t a teen with a healthy weight. Just a little disappointed but I plan to continue. I am barely under the obese cutoff now and I’m not like super muscular or anything. \n\nI want to be healthy and happy for my kids and for me. I just feel like obesity and overweight has become so common that a healthy weight like bmi 24 is seen as too thin by many",
          "+18kg due to long covid. Can medication be a solution ? . I (31M) was chubby but athletic 4 years ago. Always struggled with weight gain since I am a kid but took it under control with a lot of sports and intermittent fasting from 2017 to 2020. \n\nUnfortunately in 2020 I developed long COVID, at the time I didn't know it was that so I tested for everything included thyroid function and was given antidepressants. During one year I took 7 kgs. Stopped it 2.5years ago but I can't stop putting weight on. Due to long covid I cannot do sports as I used to. \n\nIn total I have gained 18kg and today I saw myself in a story of someone who was filming the crowd, not intentionally me. And I am so BIIIIG. It made me cry because I struggled so hard to lose that weight the first time. \n\nThe thing is my doctor already suggested ozempic but I am very afraid of side effects on the long run (cancers, unknown effect) and I am also afraid of worsening my long covid. But I have to face the fact that I cannot do sports so maybe it is my only option ? Does ozempic works if someone doesn't workout ?",
          "Greta job! I am a M28 5’5 and 220. I have an appointment this week to talk about wegovy (off brand ozempic). \n\nI’ve done 1200 calories myself and the scale does not budge.  I also weight train 4 days of the week and cardio 4-5 times. Sure, my weekend eating habits are not the best but can 1-2 days really prevent noticeable weight loss? My question to you is - what was your bp before and now? That’s my concern as mine is pretty high 150-155/90-95",
          "I finally reached my goal weight… now I feel like I’m losing it all. I went from around 70 kg (155 lbs) to 55 kg (121 lbs), with my lowest weight being 53 kg (116 lbs). I used Ozempic to help me achieve this — I had struggled with fat loss my entire life, and it truly worked wonders for me. I’m now at my goal weight and pretty close to my ideal physique.\n\nFor the first four months on Ozempic, I was doing everything right: eating well, hitting my protein goals, staying in a calorie deficit, and training 5 days a week. Then, I moved to Southeast Asia for 3.5 months, and that’s when things started to shift. I stopped prioritising my health — I was drinking a lot, barely eating one day then overdoing it the next, eating out constantly, partying often, and not tracking my macros. I still worked out occasionally but my routine was all over the place. Despite all this, I kept losing weight and loved how I looked — but it came with a price. Due to the lack of proper nutrition and consistent training, I lost my glutes and muscle tone.\n\nI’m now back home for two months to see my family, and I feel like it’s the perfect time to undo the damage from those 3.5 months. I’ve started eating properly again — but it’s been a challenge. Eating feels like a chore now because I got so used to eating very little. Since I’ve increased my food intake, I’m essentially doing a reverse diet. The issue is, I didn’t track anything while I was away, so I don’t actually know how many calories to reverse from. Right now, I’m eating between 1,200–1,800 calories a day.\n\nIt’s been 12 days, and honestly, I don’t know if it’s just body dysmorphia, but I feel bigger than ever. I checked my body fat percentage 5 days ago and it was 15%, but my brain is telling me otherwise. Now that I’m eating again, I have this fear that all my progress is going to disappear — and it really scares me.\n\nFor context, I’ve completely cut out sugar, I’m only eating whole foods, and I’m getting between 120–170g of protein a day. I’ve also stopped taking Ozempic about 2–3 weeks ago. I’m training hard again — lifting weights and doing at least 30 minutes of cardio every day.\n\nWhat I need to know is: am I ruining my progress by eating more again, or is this just a “trust the process” phase? Should I be more careful with my food intake or just ride it out and let my body adjust?\n\nI’m 27, female, and 167 cm tall.\n",
          "My motivation is to be healthy enough to do a month long trip to Australia and do all the walking - when we start phasing into retirement in 5 years.\n\nAnd you didn't ask for food ideas - but since Halloween is your motivator - check this out.\n\nhttps://www.fantasticfunandlearning.com/healthy-halloween-snacks-kids.html",
          "That’s a great motivation! My daughter and my health, confidence, and being able to dress how I want again are my main motivations. For me I put lots of pictures on my wall.. old photos of me where I felt good, even some more recent ones that I hate. It might be helpful to put some photos of the costumes you want to wear and that sort of thing. I have some inspo on my phone wallpaper and lock screen too, to constantly keep me in check if I’m out and thinking of eating what I shouldn’t. Kind of basic but yeah, it really does help me to be constantly reminded.",

          "Trick or treating never looked so good! Here are some easy tips to help you lose weight for Halloween while still enjoying the festivities: \r  \n1. Eat a light breakfast before going out. This will prevent you from getting too hungry and eating junk food on Halloween.\r  \n1. Keep your celebrations low-key. If you’re not going to eat any candy, don’t let yourself indulge in unhealthy snacks.\r  \n1. Avoid sugary drinks. This includes juice, milk, and soda. Drink water instead.\r  \n1. Skip the processed foods. These will only make you feel tired and bloated. Instead, stick to healthier options like fruits and vegetables.\r  \n1. Take a brisk walk after trick or treating. This will help burn off any extra calories and give you a healthy glow.",
          "Halloween is the best! I have many motivations - one of them being comfortably swimming in public. I love swimming. I love going to beaches and pools and waterparks… at least I used to love them. As I got older (and bigger), I’ve lost a lot of confidence. I hate it. I wear a big shirt to cover everything up when swimming, which just isn’t the same and is embarrassing in its own right.",
          "I want to lose weight for Halloween 🎃. I (21F) weigh about 100 kg (around 220 pounds) and one of my biggest motivators to lose weight is halloween.\n\nI love everything scary and spooky. I've never been to a halloween party, but I know that if I was ever invited to one (or if I threw one myself and invited my friends) I would want to dress up. Wear a funny or hot or ridiculous or sexy halloween costume. And just have fun with my friends.\n\nBut most halloween costumes I want are for smaller people. Of course, bigger people like myself can rock them too, but I would feel more comfortable wearing them if I was closer to a more healthy weight.\n\nThis halloween I want to have lost some weight. Not putting a number on it, but I want to be closer to my goal of 70 kg (155 pounds isch). Like I would love to dress up as a hot nurse, or a pirate, or a witch! Maybe that's a dumb motivation, but I am really looking forward to being hot in a halloween custome 🎃\n\nWhat kind of motivations do you guys have for losing weight? Outside of being more healthy of course.\n\nEdit: Since there were way more people commenting than I expected I just wanted to edit and say thank you guys for taking the time to write and thanks for all the kind words!

I know there might be a mental block to get over with ”do I want people to see me in bathers when I look like this?”, but the water will help support your weight and take strain off your joints, so whatever movement you’re doing won’t hurt as much. There is a reason they use hydrotherapy/warm pools as part of rehabilitation after surgery or injury. It’s a way of gentling the impact on your body while you get used to moving freely again.",
          "Thank you so much!! Definitely listen to your nephrologist. Swimming is such a great low impact exercise. Another option is to check your local parks. We have a park near us that has a senior center right next to it, or it is maybe even a part of it, but it is open to the public. They have a paved trail that is flat and has exercise equipment along the route. It is equipment that has low impact exercises for older people, which has railing and such to help people with mobility issues. Some of the equipment on the circuit that I can remember would help with balance and core, or you could do assisted squats and stretches and such. I mean, I don't know your age, but some of the least injury inducing physical activities you can do are going to be those recommended or designed for our older generations. So seeing what is out there for older people in your area is a great place to start, as long as they don't have an age restriction. Things like chair yoga, or silver sneakers stuff/yoga. \n\n*Also, I guess I felt like talking a lot and having verbal diarrhea, so it is up to you if you want to continue and read my rambling novel below. I mean I go onto a few tangents, haha. Sorry but I guess I just felt like saying a lot.*\n\nIs there any sort of way of eating your doctor can recommend? I googled because I figured protein would need to be restricted, but it looks like protein, fat, and processed carbs are all things to monitor/limit (DASH diet). So, I would keep it to filling fruits and veggies if hunger is an issue. Maybe things high in fiber because they take longer to digest and can make you feel fuller for longer. The protein rec I saw is very low (6 oz a day of lean meats or eggs), so that could be tough. \n\nRice and beans are allowed a decent amount and absolutely delicious. If you have a pressure cooker, I would make them a weekly staple. My instant pot makes perfect white rice so easily (rinse rice-I use jasmine rice. Put rice and water or broth/stock into the I",

Those moments you spend walking are really good for you. Go gently and be mindful of your joints.\n\nIf there were a way to get to a swimming pool, aqua jogging would be a very safe, fun, and healthy activity. It would take the weight off your joints and allow you to get some movement going more comfortably.\n\nAll the best to you 😊. You can do this!",

          "Is there anyway you can access a swimming pool? \nMy mom taught et water aerobics for years. Getting into the shallow end and walking back and forth takes a lot of pressure off your joints, but is still solid as exercise and conditioning your body to move easier again. Leggings and a long T-shirt are absolutely okay if you aren’t comfortable in a swimsuit. I’m a massage therapist and I have recommended water therapy to a lot of clients working through different stages of mobility \n\nBest of luck to you 🙏",

That may be easier on your joints, plus (for me) it's just such a zen experience to be in the water! \n\nAnd it's great for cardio if you start taking more strokes between breaths of air - I can do up to 7 strokes now, and my goal is someday to be able to swim across the local 25m pool with just 3 or 4 breaths.\n\nNote: Swimming makes me ravenously hungry - watch out for the urge to munch, munch, munch all day!",

It's progressive and is almost never picked up on in its early stages, if at all (like most female health problems). \n\nIt can seriously damage your lymphatic and venous systems...yet Drs are often fat phobic so ignore it. Their advice - like weightloss medication is the worst possible thing for it. Losing the diseased fat already present is not possible by diet and exercise, however progression can be slowed with the right diet (eating enough & clean low carb), compression, etc. Surgery is also very helpful for people. \n\nTwo important tips ❤️\n1) Remember that information and pictures on the internet about this disease can give a very narrow POV. It presents itself differently in different  people (for example, I don't have the characteristic ankle cuffs). \n2) If you see a Dr to see if you have this, please please please see one that actually knows about the disease. Some do telehealth consults if you don't live near one. I got diagnosed in a different country to me - by 'walk with freedom' and 'McQuarie University' Australia. \n\nBig hugs",

Small changes over time will add up and like others below said, dealing with your mental health will help so much and make your journey in weightloss a lot easier. It sounds like you really care about your children and want to be there for them as long as possible. I would focus more on health and just becoming a bit more active and like others have stated as well, keep track of everything you eat atleast until you get a better grasp on your intake. I would figure out what your BMR is as well as your TDEE and that all should be a good jumping off point. I wish you the best. The fact that you are worrying about this and want to prioritize it is a great sign. Losing weight is hard regardless of what anyone says. I hope you make great strides in reaching your goals. My heart aches for you.",

          "I think you gotta be you.  You are losing weight in a healthy manner and it really isn't anyone's business at this point - there is no danger (at least that you have shared).  I just said tonight to the kids when they asked if I wanted pizza - I said no I have to do better.  You do whatever but I have to do better for me.  And then they said how hard it is if everyone isn't doing it / making healthier choices together and I just said - I'm not making anymore excuses - eat what you like when, no judgement, but I personally have to do better for me. My kids are all adults (just tossing that out there in case folks are wondering).   \n\nIt's no ones business. It really isn't - I think it's personal.  \n\nSo just do your thing & keep it healthy, keep your head in the game.  Make sure at least privately to track your stats - that'll get through the plateaus and just enjoy doing what you are doing! Good Luck!",
          "Here’s the real advice: \nYou probably need to go through some therapy to make this work for you. You have to get rid of the mental baggage to really lose the physical baggage. I know you’re going through a rough time. I know it’s not easy. Start “small.” Get rid of the junk food. Just don’t have it in your house (your kids will survive without it). Your coffees just need to be with different ingredients. Maybe make it at home. Get a milk frother to make lattes at home, and use healthier milk options (oatmilk is a great option) but really, get some professional help. You deserve a pro who’s helping you through this.",

Keep in mind it will take time and consistency is everything. If you can do it one day at a time for long enough you can undo it and be what you want to be. A great podcast I've gotten a lot out of is called Half Size Me and you can check it out if you'd like. I wish you the very best and am glad you are still here fighting for yourself and your kids!",

Also, could you send replacements for X, Y, and Z recipes, as I mentioned in my consultation I don't eat X, Y, and Z and I'd like to make room for recipes that are better suited to me. \n\nIf this is just the final straw, I'm sorry, I know it's discouraging but I think you should just find a different clinic/doctor.

At the moment I don't really have any day-to-day fatigue within my normal energy window, which could be way smaller, but if I go beyond it (like I discussed above) I do still get PEM.\n\nI think you're right that I'm underestimating my actual calories. I'm not used to being so inactive/needing so little food since I was getting around 15k steps a day walking around my city and cycling with resistance 3 - 4 times a week before the PEM started/repeated crashes must have made my window smaller. Also realized I misspoke--the person I'm working with is indeed a dietician not a nutritionist!\n\nI had no idea that beta blockers could contribute to weight gain until your comment! Woah. I wonder if that's in comparison to heart rate before, i.e. people with POTS who would be burning more calories than otherwise because of their high heart rate go back to a normal person's baseline with BBs. \n\nHave you heard anything about people with Long COVID or ME/CFS having higher caloric needs overall (all other metrics the same) because cells are switching from aerobic to anaerobic energy at such a low threshold/the oxidative metabolism is messed up? I was looking at a recovery subreddit last night and saw someone talking about that, but it may be just a theory.\n\nReally appreciate your thoughtful response. I know it might seem silly to be concerned about my weight while dealing with chronic illness like this, it's just taken such an additional toll on my mental health in the midst of an overall pretty bad time that I feel pretty desperate to get back to a good place with my body image.",
          "I'm 220 and I tell you I have palpitations and I got checked out my cardiologist and he said it was my weight so your weight is a huge contributor and don't feel bad if you can't do cardio I just started walking again and I couldn't walk for two years start slow walk 5 minutes then 10 minutes then 15 I do 20 a day I started at 5:00 even if you can't breathe in short of breath keep going I'm still short of 🫁 how old are you I'm 34 so if you're in your 30s it's most likely nothing serious with your heart but just check to be safe but it's most likely your weight like mine",
          "OP, there is lots of great advice here which I can’t top. \n\nBut I have the cardiology background (I had open heart surgery last year) that hopefully I can talk to. \n\nFirst off, big internet hug. I know exactly how terrifying this is.  \n\nI’m sure you are on blood pressure medications, medications to control your weight/suppress your appetite, etc. \n\nBut I would ask if you have considered cardio physical therapy.  Usually this is done post surgery, but I wonder if it would be good for you pre-surgery (or to avoid surgery). \n\nCardio PT is where you are put onto a heart monitor while doing physical exercise.  It is guided by physical therapists and there is a big scary button on the wall that will have a cardiology crash team on the floor in under 2 minutes. \n\nThis may be a “safer” way for you to work to strengthening the muscles of your heart. \n\nThinned ventricles are like an atrophied muscle.  Breathing exercises are things you can do at home to strengthen the heart muscle. \n\nThere is a thing the cardiology department will give you that you blow into(mine is clear with green accents).  You feel stupid doing it, but it does wonders for strengthening your heart. I had to use it while I was recovering last year. It is harder than it looks. \n\nWhile you don’t want to strain your heart, you do want to strengthen your heart. Physical therapy exercises that focus on strengthening can help you improve heart health while loosing the weight. \n\nAs always, only do this under the guidance of your cardiologist and if you feel light headed or pain, stop. \n\nAnd cut down your sodium content. Below 1500mg per day.",

          "Don’t fast. It’s stressful also and could cause you to binge. Until your appointment, just focus on cutting back your eating. Seriously. Weigh all your food and record it in an app like Cronometer. That way you’ll have a food log to show at your appointment. Aim for about 2500 calories a day to start. Focus on foods that are less likely to cause inflammation. Complex vegetables. Get plenty of protein to keep you fuller longer and help with blood sugar. Cut sodas, sweet tea, juice if you haven’t already. \n\nThat’s the way to start. Don’t stress your heart doing dedicated exercise you’re not used to. But move.

          "Friend I am 5'3\" and started counting calories when I hit 235 in September. Today the scale said 215. That's 20 lbs over ~16 weeks. If I keep this up I will hit my initial goal of 185 before next Halloween 🤞\n\nYou can do this but you will have to count calories and think about your food. I can't have 3 iced lattes a day. I can't have chips without weighing them. I needed to add more veggies into my diet - more filling, less calories, more nutrients. I use a basic kitchen scale and the LoseIt app which has been very helpful to me. \n\nHowever I agree with others that the heart palpitations mean you should speak to a doctor. I definitely get not wanting to go. But there's being out of breath after exercise and then there's your body straining for other reasons. You need to get your heart checked and possibly your lungs looked at. At 235 I was more uncomfortable than I am now, but I could still walk a leisurely mile to work.\n\nYou deserve to get care. Think about what was happening in your life when these symptoms started. Write down some observations about your routine, sleep, etc. and your symptoms for the appointment. I know it sucks but if it makes you feel better Reddit also gently prodded me into starting a \"why is this happening to me\" medical journey. We can do it together.",
          "Even if you think your heart palpitations are from being obese, still go to a doctor to get yourself checked on by a professional. You shouldn’t just write off a health concern because you’re overweight.\nAlso you can do cardio at your weight. Cardio can literally just be walking for 30 minutes at your own pace. \nA little mindset tip, don’t go for quickness. Go for consistency. It’s a boring approach and you will have to have patience but if you don’t want to gain it back and you want to truly improve your health, this is your best option. Quick fixes are just bandaids for a huge problem. Take the time. Be patient with yourself and your body.",
          "Life long  heart patient here. Cut out salty foods. I have high heart pressure which has also damaged the arteries to my lungs (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension) and two things  my dr has advised. Restrict the amount of fluid and cut out salt. I was diagnosed with high pressure when I was so out of breath I couldn't walk up the same flight of stairs I do each day and my clothes no longer fitted.\n\nThey did a RHC and pumped me full of diuretics. I lost 4kg of fluid in 4 days. That fluid was putting pressure my system.\n\nNow no salty foods (good bye chips and sauces and take away food) and  on fluid restrictions of 1.5ltrs of fluid a day..2 if it's really hot.\n\nI'm allowed to exercise  walking only. No big hills just moving on a flat surface\n I eat 3 meals a day no snacks",
          "Please see a doctor for a complete check-up, your breathing issues and palpitations could be related to a more serious underlying health condition. Losing weight is important, but your health and safety come first. Take care and please keep us updated on your journey.",
          "I also highly suggest you get a blood panel done to see what your cholesterol, sugar, vitamins, and thyroid levels are as well. High cholesterol often stiffens the arteries which could make you feel as if you're experiencing the onset of a heart attack or related palpitations. Get those checked out. And since you're experiencing some rather strenious tension in your heart, please don't start going after intense exercise. Start light. You'd be surprised what 25-30 minutes of walking (at any pace) can do for your body at your weight. Let your body get used to it and like many here are commenting, reduce your caloric intake but perhaps reduce it by a little bit (for example: 250 cal) and see how that goes. If you **cannot keep the weight back off** then often the culprit is intense caloric reduction which is followed by intense cravings from your body aka survival mode. So dial it back slowly and gradually work your way up so your body isn't panicking! Best of luck!",
          "Finding the right tools. So I’ve always lost and gained weight. Biggest weight loss I had was in 2022 of 80 pounds. But do to life changes and me not able to handle it. I gained it back and then some.  I do have to use weight loss tools such as WW or Noom. I’m ready again. I was so happy when I was losing that weight. And I mean I was so happy with my life in general. And then a couple of life events happened that if I had known the toll it was going to take on me. I would have done something different and not let it engulf me to the point of where I’m at now. \n\nIt hurts my heart to know I can do this but scares me terribly of not even giving myself the opportunity to be successful before I go and shut my self down. \n\nMy apologies for just rambling.

I had no job, no money, and no direction. I was forced to get a job. That job was pushing shopping carts 8 hours a day, and then I had to eat whatever my sister cooked, which was usually turkey helper. I lost 80 lbs in a year, just living life. I owe a lot to my sister, more than she knows...\n\nI unfortunately moved back to live with my dad when I was 19. I gained all the weight back, plus a little more. In my bedroom was a full-length mirror hidden in my closest... i never looked at myself. BUT, on a random day for some reason i looked in the mirror when I was naked. I just stood there. Looking at myself.  I asked myself, \"what the fuck are you doing? Look at yourself.\"  I knew that was the heaviest I was ever going to be.\n\nThat same week, a  group of my friends wanted to join Planet Fitness. There was 6 of us the first day, 2 of us the second day, and on day 3... just me. I knew that if I moved more and ate less I  would lose weight. I'd seen the success before, but this time I wanted that success. For some reason, I was just focused on not being the fat kid anymore. My mind was finally totally on board with my heart. \n\nI lost the first 100 lbs the classic way, \"eating less, moving more.\"  Took about 8 months. The problem was... I was eating far too little and moving way too much, which caused me to hit a very hard floor on the weight loss. I didn't really know what to do b/c I couldn't eat any less than I was, so I went to my DR because I was getting depressed.\n\nMy DR prescribed me this drug called Phentermine, but I also just so happened to live next to a public library, and I stumbled across this book called The Warrior Diet (OMAD Bible) around the same time. I'm not going to lie, I felt like a God on that medication, and combined with OMAD, the weight melted off of me. Year and 1/2 it took t",
          "It’s rough. Every weight loss “reverse goal” meaning every time I hit a place I never thought I’d be… 275, 300, 320, 340, 350… all of them I hit and resolved that enough was enough. Other warnings along the way too… being put on blood pressure meds, CPAP machine, low testosterone… I could feel it all slipping away from me and felt like I’d be a victim of my family DNA. \n\nBut here’s the thing… through all of it I never stopped trying… and I’m still trying. For me I felt like eventually I’d find the right combination of sustainable weight loss protocol. When I finally found it I felt like I was in control and had a majority say in it all for the first time in years. I’d worked with my doctor for 5 years trying to find the right combination of things to make the process happen. Im in the right track now and I hope to all that is good that I’m able to stay on the track… really forever. That’s what I’ve always been after- something that didn’t feel like a crash diet. I wanted something that felt like a sustainable way to live life. \n\nSo don’t lose hope. Keep trying and it’ll all click. Just keep going.",

That’s the real reason I didn’t hit my body and career goals. It wasn’t until I let off the pressure that I was able to have enough energy and positive feeling to work hard. \n\nA quote that really helped me “If you want to change something, first find a feeling of contentment.” The reason it works is because when we’re relaxed and feeling good we have more energy. We have more access to our common sense. And we’re more resilient. \n\nThe past does not exist. Dwelling on it will only hamper your progress. Your energy is precious. Don’t spend it on things you can’t change, like the past. \n\nI’d also look for inspiring stories of weight loss. Ones where it’s clear the people who did it did it out of love for themselves, not hate or judgment.",

I wanted my diet to be my decision, not a doctors.  That was when I decided that my health was more important than the food.  Now I am down 65lbs, exercise 3-4 times a week, have an ice cream bar every single night, and for the most part try not to give into the temptation.

Got a new job and lost even more weight + the relationship weight gain which felt amazing but I was still eating and drinking like a crap. \n\nIt wasn’t until I got a new office job and gained 67 lbs (the most i’ve ever gained in two months) that I realized this isn’t right.

I’m also 23 and kinda am vain… I told myself that I deserve to look and feel my best in my peak years of adulthood and I don’t wanna look back at pictures and regret never taking the initiative to lose weight.\n\nSo here I am a year and a half later, 37lbs down and still on the journey. My wake up call was mainly wanting to look my best in my 20s haha",
          "I didn’t learn. I’m pretty sure I didn’t learn anything when I was told to lose weight at 10 years old. I was a bigger kid and my blood work revealed I was prediabetic. I think I was 160-180lbs and  at the time. I was 5’4-5’6. I don’t remember the number. I just know I was bullied and didn’t like the way my clothes fit. \n\nMy parents took this seriously. I went to a nutritionist who showed me the food pyramid. No more soda, no more candy. I took lunches to school and ate sugar free jello. I ate salads with no dressing. I was very restrictive.\n\nI lost weight continuously in middle school until I was sitting at 130-135lbs and sprouted up to 5’8. I tried every sport. Softball, soccer, basketball ball, volleyball and track. My weight (and if I had any fat) still sat on my hips. I hated the way I looked but would be constantly complimented for my weight loss. \n\nIn highschool, I was a three sport athlete who cut out all bread and pasta and never drank soda. A smarta** highschool health teacher told us to download MyFitnessPal and I set my calories to the lowest setting 1,200/day. I had no business doing that. And it didn’t teach me anything.\n\nI gained and lost probably around about 20lbs a year and was in a normal weight range. By the time I was 18 and in college, I was 175. I fell anywhere between 160-190lb all of highschool.\n\nIn college was when the weight gain became noticeable, and felt terrible. I would weigh in at 199lbs and get down to 180. Then I would gain it back. I tried running, Pilates and HIIT. It was tiring and I never felt good enough. Around 22 years old, I gave up dieting and exercise almost completely. By the time I was 23, I was sitting around 220-240lbs. \n\nWhen I turned 24, I decided to change my lifestyle and I decided it wouldn’t be about the weight this time. I have been strength training and hiking for a year. I’ve seen muscle definition and I don’t get winded when walking up a hill. \n\nI was starting to accept my body and eating copious amounts of protein. Until the ozempic hit the market. I think that is why I feel worse about my body🙃 don’t know why but I feel people DO treat me differently because I am considered fat by today’s standards. \n\nI decided I want to see the muscle I have been building more. I don’t want people to treat me differently. But I still feel like in the process of losing, gaining, losing, gaining that I never learned a thing. I don’t want it to be like that this time. \n\nThis time, it feels different. I started at 240lb and I’ve lost 6lbs in 10 weeks. I just want to feel better. I want to be able to maintain this. \nI’m tired. ",
          "Year One Weight Loss journey 850lbs to 446lbs. This time last year I weighed 850lbs  on Jan 20th I decided to start my weight loss journey.   Few weeks prior to that I had made a video of my self making a resolution to lose weight, I had a revalation of sorts and decided to change.  I had gained so much weight that I was unable to catch my breath just trying to go to the restroom. I couldnt stand for longer then a few seconds. and even then my heart would race like I was running a marathon and I would give my self panic attacks trying to catch my breath, which would make it even harder to breath to the point I was in fear of just passing out and dieing right there. \n\nAt the time  I honestly thought I wanted to die, maybe I could be with my daughter again.. but there was something that didnt make sense to me.. If I wanted to die, why was I in panic everytime I was right at deaths door. Why was it I was afraid.. I figured if I was afraid of dieing then I must really want to live, and If I wanted to live I'd have to change.   So thats where the resolution came in.\n\nOn Jan 1st 2023 I made a resolution, Hell I even recorded it on camera for some kind of accountability. I had alredy tried to lose weight a couple years prior lost about 100lbs got down to 600lbs  then ended up giving up and gaining it all back and then some till I got to the 850lbs.  I had become a Diabetic at this point , my entire body was swollen you could put ur finger in my leg or belly and it would leave an imprint that wouldnt go away. I even had a horrible sore on my foot that was spreading over the top I still to this day have the scar over my foot , a dark patch where an open wound that would not heal was. Guessing this is how diabetics usually lose thier feet.\n\nI had no will power or confidence in my self that I could even achieve any weight loss, I had been on Ozempic for two months prior to this for my diabetes and ended up gaining weight on it. It was taking my hunger away, but I had realized I had never listened to hunger in the first place when it came to my eating,  It was more of a thing where you feel like your trying to fill a hole with something like food and it would never fill up is the best way I can describe it. I would wake up and the first thing I would think about is food. I would order so much food that way I could eat it through out the day, never stoping.  \n\nSo Jan 1st I made the resolution and changed my life! nah thats not how it went down I failed the next day after making the resolution and just went back to ordering food, it wasnt till the 20th of that month I had again gotten to the point I was afraid of dieing just going to the restroom. So I decided to give it everything I had to try it and I would start out slowly instead.\n\nThe first week I cut out soda and Stoped drinking any calories. Then I would progress to new rules adding one at a time(eating windows, droping carbs etc. ) I would add new rules that would never be broken, Never drink your calories, never eat other then these set hours, and it would eventually progress into trying a different diet plan each month. So I could see what worked best for me and which things I enjoyed the most out of each diet. I would keep the things that worked well and drop the stuff I didnt enjoy. I started with a normal Calorie Diet Clean chicken breast brocoli and rice,  I was hungry all the time and misreble. \n\nThere were a couple of reasons I didnt document much my first two months,  1 - I didnt even think I was gonna follow through with it This is also why I never took photos of my self.   2 - my home scale only went to 712lbs so It would be such a long time since I'd even be able to measure my weight. not that I could even stand long enough to get my weight in the begining.  My initial weight was taken from a bariatric bed while in hospital so Thats all I had to go off of in the begining till i could actually see my weight on the scale.  by end of month 2 I was surprised and shocked that my scale was actually reading numbers again( instead of ERROR). Infact I didnt believe my weight when I first saw my weight, I had to take it multiple times. My kidneys were killing me those first two months from all the water and swelling I was droping you could push your finger on any part of my body and it wouldnt leave an imprint anymore, My edema was gone all over. I was peeing like 50 times a day and had horrible back pain but It was significant change and I could actually weight my self again so I could measure the difference I was making each month.\n\nThis was a HUGE mental barrier and motivation I had recieved after seeing this. I just thought man Ill go stricter this time and see even more weight loss right? nah haha, it definetly doesnt work that way.  Your biggest gains in weight loss atleast for me, was those first 2 months I'm guessing alot of that was due to my edema all over and the water weight I had on my body.  Reguardless I would continue my journey trying a new meal plan each month. It wasnt till month 5 or 6 I think I took my self off Ozempic and started doing it on my own I was around 650lbs I wanted to make sure I was doing this on my own and what it felt like to not be on the medication so I could make sure I would be able to handle losing weight without it. I Also quit smoking the exact same month, I was chain smoking cigars or Vape Pens and I figured it would be hypocritical of me to continue or use it as a crutch to my eating. Whenever I would fast I would still smoke alot to curb my appetite. So I quit cold Turkey it was actually easier then I thought I think i had like 3 days of cravings then nothing. The first two weeks of geting off carbs was harder then it was to quit smoking.  \n\nThis is where fasting came in to help, I noticed that when Id fast after first 48 - 72 hours I'd have no hunger and it would shrink my stomach to the point my portions sizes were alot smaller when I did eat.  Worked well to transition into this for me since I was already doing eating windows I would just expand and switch to One Meal a Day mostly or Alt Day Fasting. I cycled in different Vitamins and supplements till I found the ones that worked best for me my core supplements that never really changed were the Turmeric, Apple Cider Vinegar, Vit B, D, K, and Magnesium.\n\nCarnivore- I tried Carnivore meal plan month 6 I believe, drinking nothing but water and only eating meat. I noticed such a difference in the way I felt not only was I losing weight the easiest I had ever lost weight and seeing around the same numbers but I felt amazing it made me feel so much better mood wise, I wasnt as depressed and had way more energy. I could also eat until I was satisfied, and never had to measure my food It trained me to listen to my body/hunger cues better.  When you eat food and your hungry it tastes amazing, but as you get threw your steak or steaks, and you fill up the food begins to taste horrible to the point you dont even want to eat another bite. I thought that was really cool and alot easier. I did notice I wasnt losing as much weight when I ate chicken over beef, which confused me untill I began to actually count my calorie intake again. I notice the calorie differences in the two, 24 - 28 Chicken Wings is far more calories then 2 ribeye steaks,  and with chicken wings I seem to be hungry again faster. But I love Buffalo Wings, I could eat air fried buffalo wings every day for the rest of my life, which is why chicken wings are still my go to, along with them being super easy to cook in an air fryer.\n\nCheat Days -   Alot of people dont like em or call them other things.  I enjoy them, they still alow me freedom and alow me to eat off plan for the month aslong as I get back on track the following I also like to see how my body handles certain foods when I eat off plan. I started with like 10 - 14 cheat days then I tried to cut down that number each month.  My biggest problem was making sure I was geting back on the horse afterwards or minimizing how many \"cheat days\", I would allow my self. I would also make sure to not break my other unbreakable rules during the cheat day, so No drinking calories and still utilizing an eating window,  which at this point I was on OMAD, so when I finished eating i would be done with it completly till the next day, since I was fasting regularly like I said my stomach was alot smaller and I would get full easier.\n\n I'm Still working on Portion control This is my weakest point and something I still struggle with daily. I've spent years eating insanely unhealthy portions so when I eat food or make food or order food its always still more then I can eat.. I dont understand why im so afraid of ordering food and still being hungry I dunno where this fear stems from in me but its definetly still there. So for example when I cook my chicken wings  I still cook 24 - 28  chicken wings and throw alot of food away, instead of keeping the left overs. I'm working on that alot lately.  I've never understood the people that go out to a Jack n the Box or somthing and order just one hamburger. It's so funny I hear my self talk about it now and it sounds like an Alchoholic talking about drinking, how they go out and they dont understand just having one beer with a friend, they cant understand it. Why wouldnt you want to have this great feeling all the time. It's kinda the same thing but with food for people like me. I cant speak for others this is just my experience and what I feel.\n\nExcersize - So Around month 6 I began excersizeing and began the physical therapy that I should have done years ago after my Coma. I used Resistance bands straped to the legs of my bed and got adjustable dumbells.  I'm still increadibly unstable when I walk around and I even still fall, but now I can pick my self back up when I do. I'd say my excersize is still minimal thou when comparing to alot of gym rats out there. Very Basic stuff Id say atleast with my experience most weight loss is what you put into your mouth, how much and how often.  I plan on swimming this year and geting a gym membership , then hopfully moving to weights and stuff. I'm right now just still trying to be able to walk for longer then 2 mins without my legs giving out. \n\nMonth 10 - 12 I'm finally able to fit in a car again and travle again, do things like go to a Dr apt instead of having a Dr or Nurse come to me. I can now walk around my house freely still not able to stand for longer then a few minutes but I'm working on it. I'm sure I can fit in smaller cloths aswell since I'm still wearing my 14x shirts, but honestly my skin is still hanging out from my shirts if I wear anything smaller then a shirt that looks like a dress, The amount of skin I have leftover from the damage I've done to my body is going to be significant. I still dont know what I'll be doing about all that but for right now we take it one day at a time.  I lost 400 lbs last year and this year im shooting for about half that, looking to get to 250ish by this Christmas , we'll see. \n\nMy life is still incredibly sad and depressing, dont get me wrong, and I have no illusions that losing all this weight will magically make me happy or will transform me into some story book Happy Ending... Everyday I still miss my baby girl and Every day I wake up to my lonely ass life. But your life doesnt end here It goes on and Life was never fair to start out and its not gonna be fair where it ends up, but one thing I can tell you.  When you survive the perils that life throws your way you will always find moments or times of joy that make it worth it.  I still have a son and if I want to see him make it threw his last 5 years of school and then hopfully college one day Ill have to be alive and healthy for him to do that.\n\nMy best advice I can give to anyone reading this thinking about changing, Dont fall into despair, dont revel in it thinking your life isnt going to get any better so whats the point of even trying, Dont lock your self in a room(Like me) and eat your self to death whatever your food of choice is. And im not just talking about food, for me it was food, to others it could be something else. That thing that takes you away from your pain for a lil while, gives you an escape. Your life is full of possibilities I promise you. Just take the first step and try something, then the next day take another step... untill you look back and realize you've walked miles from where you first started.  No one ever believed I could do it, most said id never lose weight unless I had bariatric surgery. You can do anything you put your mind to. In 5 years I hope I'm atleast back in school in my 40s maybe trying to become an RN or something. Everyone still tells me I cant do this.  I dont know if thats even possible for someone like me but I have a goal. I take one step at a time everyday trying to rebuild my life from ashes. You never know, You might surprise yourself.\n\nI did.\n\nHeres my weight tracking for the year.  I also try to post once a month on tiktok for accountability. havent done this month yet but im sure ill do it sometime.\n\nTake Care Yall , Love the Journey more then the Destination and you wont regret it.\n\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@keebla2](https://www.tiktok.com/@keebla2)\n\n1/20/23  850                                        \r  \n\r  \n3/5/23   712        - Home Scale stops at 712 \r  \n3/11/23  699\r  \n3/17/23  688       - Low carb transition to dirty keto\r  \n4/05/23  683\r  \n4/11/23  671\r  \n4/14/23  665\r  \n4/21/23  657       - dirty keto start\r  \n4/28/23  659\r  \n5/11/23  640\r  \n5/29/23  620       - clean Keto  start\r  \n5/31/23  618\r  \n6/5/23   618\r  \n6/12/23  612\r  \n6/16/23  608\r  \n6/20/23  607      - Start of Carnivore  buffalo wings and ribeyes\r  \n6/25/23  603\r  \n6/29/23  599\r  \n7/8/23   591\r  \n7/13/23  588\r  \n7/18/23  583\r  \n7/20/23  580      - Carnivore  just eatting chicken wings -  no cheat days.\r  \n7/25/23  578\r  \n7/30/23  574\r  \n8/2/23   570\r  \n8/11/23  563                            \r  \n8/15/23  563                          \r  \n8/20/23  563     -  Carnivore just eating Ribeye steaks  80/20 Cheat days included Barbacoa street tacos x3 and Wingstop wings x2 and 1 Day of Pizza and Icecream you can guess which week.\r  \n8/23/23  557\r  \n8/25/23  549\r  \n8/28/23  543\t\t\t       \r  \n9/4/23   538\r  \n9/6/23   536\r  \n9/13/23  549\r  \n9/17/23  544\r  \n9/20/23  535      -  Carnivore Beef and Chicken again with Alternate day fasting thrown in the mix\r  \n9/22/23  530\r  \n9/23/23  526\r  \n9/27/23  527\r  \n9/30/23  521\r  \n10/1/23  518\r  \n10/4/23  515\r  \n10/11/23 511\r  \n10/18/23 499     - Carnivore minus cheat days (3 Cheat days - Wingstop)\r  \n10/25/23 498\r  \n10/31/23 492\r  \n11/6/23  486\r  \n11/17/23 481\r  \n11/20/23 479\r  \n11/22/23 476     - Ketovore/fasting  (Carnivore with some Veggies in the mix) \r  \n11/29/23 483\t - After thanksgiving entire week of cheat days from leftovers\r  \n12/3/23  480\r  \n12/6/23  473\r  \n12/13/23 470\r  \n12/20/23 457     - Carnivore, Buffalo wings mostly with lil beef in the slow cooker ( Cheat days included All New Years Week ate out every day for 8 days includes Hamburgers, Pizza, BBQ, Fried Chicken)\r  \n1/7/24   469\r  \n1/10/24  464\r  \n1/17/24  448\r  \n1/20/24  446",
          "There are lots of reasons for me to be healthier but my number one motivator is life.  My dad and his mother both died in their early sixties of a stroke.  They just dropped.  I was not around for my grandmothers passing but I certainly was for my father’s death.  Fat or thin I love my life and want to experience as much of it as I can.  I may still have a stroke at 62 and die - I can’t change my gene, but I can certainly give myself the best odds.  \n\nBut then I started to lose the weight and things just keep getting better.  Way more energy.  I used to be falling asleep in the couch by 9pm.  I look way more conventionally attractive.  I sometimes have a hard time seeing the weight loss - the dysmorphia is strong at times (which is funny because I used to think I looked way thinner than I was, but photos don’t lie, but my brain sure does) but I catch gazes from men they will go out of their way to help me and talk to me.  Sex is way better for a lot of reasons, I’ll leave it at that.  I can go into just about any store and find my size of clothing.  I just bought a pair of jeans from a company that didn’t even make my highest sizes.  When I have a choice in front of me and I am really struggling with making the smart healthy choice, I remind myself how awesome my life has become - and I want this life more than I want the poor choice, whatever it may be.  And sometimes I plan ahead so I can have an evening where I know I plan on making some less than ideal choices - and even then my mindset is such a way where my poor choices still tend to be decent these days - I think I might legit like the healthy lifestyle on a subconscious level these days.\n\nBut I think the number one thing that has helped me stay consistent is NOT having a goal.  I have some milestones that I strive for and celebrate, like getting under 200lbs for the first time in 20 years, and now I am so close to officially losing 1/3rd of my total body weight, I will most definitely celebrate that, but not",
          "Hello, \n\nTrying to get right for like the 7th time in 8 years. I struggle with diet. I try to stick to a calorie deficit but I have been noticing when I try a deficit I get HUGE headaches (I usually get headaches when I don’t eat). Is there a way to combat this?\n\nA friend of mine suggested slowly lowering my caloric intake to the desired number not sure if this recommended. Am I just doing too much too soon?\n\nEdit: 270lbs 5’6” male btw. Overall goal is 200 lbs.",
          "How many calories are you eating per day? You should eat no less than 500kcal below maintenance otherwise your performance in the gym will drop along with libido, mood and a ton of other negative benefits. The headaches could be from a lack of water (when you eat less your body stores less water) so try up water intake 1L per 30kg. For getting maintenance calculator google Harris Benedict calculator",
          "I get migraines and I can't go 10 to 12 hours without eating. But that means I eat more frequently, but smaller meals. \n\nYou're describing a migraine. All of these you should see a doctor about. They aren't normal dieting symptoms. Regular pain relievers don't touch migraine pain.",
          "Maybe try sodium for the headaches; that happens to me if I drink too much water and eat too little food. A few weeks back I'd had a headache all day that ibuprofen couldn't shake, I decided it was a cheat day and ate some instant ramen, and my headache was gone within ten minutes.",
          "\"Every morning I start the day with a healthy breakfast, I bring a snack to work, I'm good until the afternoon wave or tiredness hits and I just can't stay away from eating a bunch of food to feel good again.\"\n\nI'm in this loop. I have headaches, and everytime I get one I try eating something else, which isn't the cause but it's hard to avoid food when you have the feeling that food might help. \n\nLots of people crash around 2pm, but there are some things you can do to avoid that crash so that you don't have that extra calories every day. \n1. Make sure you're eating a protein heavy breakfast and snack. I have a blood sugar crash if I don't eat a protein heavy breakfast. Anytime I grab something that's mostly carbs instead, I totally crash later. \n1. Make sure your lunch has a lot of protein, but isn't too filling either. If you eat a big lunch that can also cause you crash. \n1. Get more sleep, or see if there is something causing you to not sleep well, like sleep apnea. Being sleepy makes me SO hungry, so addressing your sleep can help your calories a lot. \n1. Eat slooooooowly. This is a good advice for your family dinners as well. If you eat slowly and put down your fork between every bite, drink a lot of water, you will be eating as long as everyone else, but not consuming as much. I really struggle to eat slowly, but when I do it I feel full a lot longer.",
          "OMAD doesn’t work for me at all. But I’d also try drinking more water. You are not getting water from food, and may be  dehydrated. Those headaches sound like me without water. \n\nI found 3 low calorie, high protein meals a few days a week seems to sustain my energy a lot better. I have eggs or a protein smoothie for breakfast, leftover meat, egg and/or cheese with salad for lunch and a slightly more substantial dinner as I sleep better with more. I also drink about 9 glssses of water as otherwise killer headaches.",
          "In addition, try to eat smaller amounts more times a day. I eat little bits during the day, then have a bigger dinner, and also an evening snack. This prevents me from getting blood sugar drops and associated headaches.",
          "Weight loss plans are good, but you have to be reasonable. I get headaches like this too, so no matter how many people recommend it I'm not going to do full IF. If I had that bad a headache I would drink a lot of water and eat something small before taking 8 ibuprofen!! I've learned that a headache-ending meal has to be well-rounded, not just like an apple. Needs some fat, carbs, and protein.",

          "> I dunno, I'm sure everyone deals with this and it's not even that big a deal, but it sucks.\n\nActually no. Never head of hunger hiccups. Stomach cramps would be more of a reaction to \"actual\", keep you from starving yourself, Hunger. That is not something that should happen if you don't eat for a few hours. MAYBE at the very beginning of  a diet if your body is used to constant intake of huge amounts of calories, but not even with intermittent fasting should you get cramps regularly. Headaches ? Again, not normal unless you are actually starving and dehydrated. More so dehydration than hunger.\n\nYou should talk to a medical professional, your symptoms are, by no means, \"normal\".\n\n8 ibuprofens, Jesus, that is the daily dose 2-4 times depending on serving size.\n\nActually, pain killers like Ibuprofen attack the gastric mucosa IIRC, are you using them regularly ?",
          "I really believe IF should be limited to those with normal or close to normal metabolic pathways. If hunger and headaches are that big of a problem you may have other stuff going on. Like uncontrolled blood sugar or hormone imbalances. A lot of people swear by Keto if you can do it, I think it’s mostly due to Keto being really good at controlling blood sugar quickly, but you have to stick with it. If you can get some blood work done or see a dietician to get a plan for an eating program that doesn’t make you feel like a wet noodle!",
          "I get super nauseous and headaches when I go without eating for more than 6 hours. I can’t fast bc I know that it makes me feel so sick. I suggest you eat smaller more frequent meals.

That’s my ideal day.",
          "In your post, you mentioned that you had an A1C of 16 at some point. What is it now? I ask because if you are struggling with diabetes, you need to see an endocrinologist. They will also give you more sensible advice regarding the diet aspect.\n\nIn addition, I am really sceptical of a doctor suggesting berberine supplements. Unlike pharmaceutical compounds, supplements are hard to dose and, in the US at least, are not well-regulated. \n\nFor diet recommendations, if you can, you should consult with someone in a bariatric center.  You don't have to go down the route of surgery or medication, but they will have much more experience with prescribing a diet and recommending monitoring for things like possible vitamin deficiencies that can pop up with aggressive calorie deficits.\n\nGood luck and get a better medical team to help you!",
          "To throw in a more positive experience, I started at 250 lbs 6'1\" male 34 years old. I lost 40 pounds CICO thru weight watchers. After that loss I decided it was a good time to get some blood work done. Compare before and afters to make sure everything was good. Doctor ordered some blood work and an EKG (I had a before COVID EKG and she wanted an after COVID EKG -I had not had COVID at this time). EKG came back as \"non-specific t wave abnormality\" which means my heart repolarizes slightly differently but isn't indicative of anything serious. But I was sent to a specialist to make sure. \n\nBy this point I was around 210. For further Conte t, I was diagnosed at 22 as type 2 diabetic and had been told that losing weight wouldn't reverse it (due to age and having sugars between 25-30 mmol/L (450 to 540 for the weird American units). I had been taking metformin 1000mg x2 day plus dimicron. I was switched to ozempic 1mg (stepwise increases 0.25x3,0.5x3, 0.75x3, 1mg) plus an SGLT2 inhibitor. No more metformin no more dimicron. In three months I lost 25lbs and my A1C went from 6.1 to 5.7.\n\nWhat about diet? My struggle with weight wasn't over eating. I drank most of my calories (love milk).I didn't struggle with binging. My actual struggle was when I got hungry. My hunger signals are quite intense. I dropped my first 40 by making sure I was never hungry. Small snacks to keep me from getting hungry. If u get hungry I get anxious, I get shaky, I get angry,  it is super unpleasant. And I have a hard time stopping eating when I know I have had enough because I see feel shaky, I still feel hungry. If I got hungry I would inevitably over eat. \n\nOn ozempic, that was the first time I have ever thought intermittent fasting was possible for me. I could wake up and not feel even remotely hungry until 4pm. Normally I would need to eat by 10 or be shaky, angry and anxious. Repeat at 4pm. And even at 4, I wouldn't fell hunger like I did before. It was a feeling of \"I could eat but I don't",
          "I am sorry that you had such bad experience with doctors and dieticians. That sounds incredibly frustrating.\n\nIt just seems that you are not being given very helpful advice as far as your diet and blood sugar goes. 5.4 is obviously fine, but if you had very high A1C before your doctor should have it checked since it's pretty easy to do!",
          "Very well spoken.  I agree.  When you spoke of having a normal A1C, this is why your endocrinologist checks insulin levels.\n\n  People who can get fat easily, they use the carbs by making fat.  This keeps the numbers normal, but it is in no way normal. \n\n Some people can shuttle the glucose into fat storage and prevent elevated blood glucose levels.  It is kinda like shoving everything into a closet instead of cleaning your bedroom.  Mom comes in and says, \"Good job on keeping your room clean.\"  Eventually you run out of closet space and then it spills over into your bedroom.\n\n  The endocrinologist checking the insulin levels is like mom looking in the closet.  She knows that things are not right with your process of room cleaning.  If a doctor only checks the A1C, they really don't know what is going on, unless you are down in weight and also have a normal A1C.  Then it is still a guess.  A person could have cancer or some other cause of weight loss.  \n\nWe must do our due diligence.  Only the patient knows the truth about what they are eating.  I know people will go in to the doctor and make sure not to eat beforehand, as.to have a lower blood glucose level.  Then they will eat all day.  This is why the A1C was so useful.  It gives an average of the last 3 months.  But now, the insulin level is really telling the story.",

Being obese is also a risk factor for so many things including oh I don't know...diabetes. I am not yet diabetic, but I have hypothyroidism, and hereditary hyperlipidemia. I AM prediabetic. Did you know that your body will actually work against you when you reach a certain weight? So yeah, the constant nausea, freezing cold, sulfur burps and injecting myself weekly for the pleasure is very much worth it, as my A1C is down, as well my blood pressure, cholesterol and yes my weight",
          "Tell people you are on a path to attain a much higher degree of metabolic health.  Don’t tell them you are trying to lose weight or are on a diet.  Instead, tell them you have been working closely with medical professionals and you found that your metabolic health was not anywhere near optimum.  And are doing this program with close monitoring by your primary care physician.  That your HbA1c was much too high as well as your HomaIR.  Get those both tested.  You will need to study these in great detail.  Tell them your supposed old results, then tell them your current results and that your target is to get your HbA1c below 5.4, and your HomaIR down below 1.5.  \nThen, ask them what their HbA1c and HomaIR is?  If they say they have no idea, give them the wide eyed gaping mouth stare, and say, “you don’t know your numbers?  How can you ever know what your metabolic health is if you don’t even have these numbers.”  When they say they don’t even know what that is, shake your head side to side and shame them.  Then, give them a lecture and tell them what they are and what they mean in great detail.  Then tell them that when you get your metabolic health tested, you go to ultalabtests.com and order the “suspected insulin resistance” test, and then schedule the blood draw at questdiagnostics.com .  Tell them that for $53 they can get an HbA1c, a fasted glucose, and a fasted insulin.  From the latter 2 it is easy to calculate a HomaIR.  \nTo learn what these are, I have included 2 video links and a link to a chart below.  \nOnce you do this, they won’t pester you any more for fear of getting another lecture of yet another thing they are not taking care of about their health.  Or, maybe you will teach them something and help them out.\n\nIf they persist on the weight loss, give them a phone number for your doctor, and tell them to call your doctor and tell him he is an ignorant POS and doesn't know what he is doing.

          "I’m on a weight loss journey currently. 30F started at 276lbs at 5’4” and now down to 245lbs 6 months later. Up until this fall I’d tried dieting and exercising in the past to lose weight but I was never able to keep it up for long or I’d find I was somehow gaining weight despite hard work. Part of what did this to me was actually my body becoming insulin resistant! Surprisingly, when your body begins to lose the ability to use insulin properly, you feel hungry despite having eaten and end up eating more to fill the void, which just makes it worse. First thing you should do is make a doctors appointment to have your A1C checked because chances are good that you may be experiencing insulin resistance. Insulin resistance also makes you feel tired and have less desire to exercise and eat properly so you become a snake eating itself, stuck in a cycle you physically can’t change. My doctor put me on medications to help manage my blood glucose and before she did that she got me a continuous glucose monitor to check my blood sugar. Actually seeing what certain foods did to my body and blood sugar helped me make better choices and changes that I wouldn’t have even thought of otherwise. It’s one thing to be told to eat leafy greens, but it’s completely different to eat them and see what affect it has on your glucose in real time.",

On top of it all, got a surprise diagnosis of diabetes with an A1C of 9.5. \nA1C at last check was 5.3, and I’ve decided to keep going and get down to sub 145.

I did start taking metformin  recently, but it did not speed up my loss at all, as I lost the bulk of the weight way before. In fact it is going sooo much slower now. Since I am now in a normal BMI I know it’s going to take a while to get to goal but that’s ok.",

Chances are  that will leave you thinnER but not always. The important thing is for the changes you make to be sustainable, otherwise you’re just setting yourself up for failure.\n\nRight now I’m at 183 and my goal is to get to 165. I’ll still be overweight for my height. But that will be over 30lbs off my knees (started at 199) and I know it will be easier to maintain than my absolute ideal weight.",

I want to get to around 140, so I am half-way there, and the best investment for me has been working with a sports dietician. Note: I also maintain a high volume of exercise (right now, I am running high volume, lifting regularly, and rock climbing), so the sports part of this was crucial as I want to be able to have good workouts and I am willing to lose more slowly to achieve that! Depending on what your workout goals are, you may or may not need someone who specializes in sports nutrition.",

          "It's all pretty subjective. My weight has fluctuated a *lot* over the course of my life due to various circumstances - according to BMI charts, my ideal weight should be 120-125ish, but I was about 140 at my healthiest. I could lift more and my endurance was so much better at 140 than when I was 120. At 120 I was tired, had a thigh gap, and didn't like how I looked at all. Currently I'm just trying to get back down to about 150 while focusing more on cardiovascular endurance, physical strength, and muscle tone than my actual weight. I wouldn't mind being buffer than I was at 140 TBH. I think just carrying around extra weight has increased my overall muscle mass in general anyway. My legs are solid AF.",

Goal weights for me are basically anything in the healthy BMI range, but because I've never been a healthy weight as an adult or even as a teen my plan is to get to healthy BMI range and then reassess every 5lbs to determine where I need to be.\n\nThe first healthy BMI weight will be 10st 8lbs I think that's 148lbs. So then I'll reassess every 5lbs after that. I assume I'll end up maybe in the 130s but I'm really not sure :). All brand new to me ha.",
          "That weight is really low for your height. Can I suggest 200lb instead?",
          "You really don't need to worry about a specific goal weight right now.  If your weight is getting lower over time (aside from normal fluctuations), you're on the right track.  You have quite a bit of weight to lose, and it will be hard to know until you get closer to a healthy weight what will be (a) healthy and (b) sustainable for your body and life.\n\nWhere are you getting 115 pounds as what you \"should\" weigh?  That would put your BMI at 21, which is on the low end of \"normal.\"  I don't want to suggest that you use BMI as a measure of what a healthy weight is for you or any individual, but using it as a ballpark estimate of weight range for your height, it is unlikely that this would be an achievable and sustainable weight for someone starting out obese.\n\nI discourage people from getting hung up on the number on the scale because that doesn't come close to telling the whole story of your health and how you feel and look.  If you feel that you need a specific number to use as a goal, 140 seems pretty reasonable since your experience tells you that this is (or at least has been in the past) a good weight for you.  Once you get there, you can absolutely evaluate whether that's still a good weight that you can sustain, or if you will need to lose more to achieve the health metrics or other non-scale attributes that you want.",
          "I'm similar to you 130-145 is a healthy bmi for me but I'm aiming for around 150 to start with (a 45lb loss) because looking back that was the weight that suited me mentally, and lifestyle wise the best. I just need to keep trying!",
          "150lbs at 180cm seems under weight, i was 187cm 184lbs and i was bonny thin i think 240lbs would be a more attainable goal even sub 200 if you can.\n\nlosing that much seems like you would need medical help as its major weight loss.",
          "Most \"Ideal Weight\" charts are based on data from insurance companies and only use height, weight, and sex to come up with the numbers.  They do not take into consideration things like someone's build or amount of muscle.  Also, if you do a search, you will find different numbers on different charts, and some charts give a range rather than a fixed number.  So consider them a starting point only, not a rule.\n\nFor me, I know I felt fit, had energy, and looked good when I weighed 150lbs.  At 5'6\" tall, most charts say I should weigh 130-135, sometimes 128, sometimes 140.  Other than using those numbers as simply a reference, I ignore them.  I know what weight is good for me.  And, when I get back down to that weight, if I want to go a bit lower, then I can change my goal.  Being flexible is perfectly fine.\n\nMany people prefer to set short-term goals rather than their ultimate goal weight, such as getting below a certain number, or losing in increments.  They find it more encouraging to focus on a number that doesn't seem so far away.  Once they reach that goal, they set a new one.\n\nYou do you.  If you know you felt great at 140, then set that as your goal.  You can always change it when you get there.",

          "My allergist (who is the only doctor I’ve ever had that spent time sitting with me and discussing anything health related I want to) suggested a while back that I talk to my PCP and ask about ozempic.  This write up and everyone’s comments are giving me the kick to actually follow through on that.  \n\nAlso it is a revelation to me that most people stop feeling hungry after eating.  I’m like OP- I don’t think I ever feel full.  It’s always a battle of willpower to NOT eat more; and I usually lose.  So that’s not normal? Like most folks eat and then feel full!?? Holy hell… for me it’s eat, and eventually I either eat all that’s on my plate and decide I’ve had enough, or eat until I’m miserable stuffed (like thanksgiving or at a buffet).  I honestly don’t really ever stop feeling hungry.",

          "I am very interested in taking ozempic for weight loss.  I am not diabetic or prediabetic, but have a long history of obesity.  My doctor is doing some research, but is feeling unsure about prescribing for weight loss as this use/dosage has not yet been FDA approved.  I wonder how your doctor thinks about this?  Any suggestions on how to approach one's physician? And, if you are not diabetic, does insurance cover the mediation?\n\nThank you very much!",
          "As someone who lost 100lbs naturally and is now on ozempic (on and off), I recommend using this time to learn how to count calories effectively. I lost 100lbs with CICO and I know I would have gained during the “off” periods if I hadn’t learned how to use a food scale and count calories before. \n\nSome people are on the drug for life though so if that’s your case then this advice is moot",
          "No no no.\n\nThere's plenty of semaglitude to go around. The issue is the special injection pens that Ozempic uses is out of stock. \n\nWegovy is similar, specific for weight loss. Those who use it for weigh loss use Wegovy, not Ozempic. \n\n>the ozempic craze many of those people who rely on that medication can't get it",
          "The reason why ozempic works is that in inhibits your ability to take in calories because it delays gastric emptying. The reason why prednisone makes you gain weight is because it makes you ravenous. The reason why being older makes you gain weight is that your metabolism (calories out) slows down. It's all calories, all of it. In vs out. The person eating only carrots, salad and protein and gaining weight is eating more calories of those foods than they need to maintain.\n\nYes, people can be complete assholes for no reason about people who use it, but you absolutely need to understand what and why you are losing weight on it so you can maintain that loss afterwards. You are eating fewer calories. That's all.",
          "This is incorrect. Ozempic lowers blood sugar levels by mimicking the effects of GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion from the liver. If you understand science, one reason why someone might gain weight is because their body is insulin resistant (PCOS, Diabetes), their body does not recognize when insulin is released and thus does not take up glucose from their blood, causing their blood glucose to spike. A blood glucose spike causes weight gain because it tells your body to start storing glucose as fat. This process has literally nothing to do with calories, but it explains why many people still gain weight even when they are eating low calorie meals that contain glucose. Thus, the two options for this type of person is to drastically decrease their glucose intake OR to regulate it using Ozempic (or Metformin). Thus, people might be losing weight on Ozempic because it's having their body properly manage the insulin/glucose relationship and they stop storing glucose as fat while you are in a caloric deficit.",

Once off you have to work really hard every day not to relapse, it often involves meetings, sponsors, feeling really rough all the time, but after a while you can get through it. Instead of feeling like you want to rip your skin off, temperature fluctuations, and horrible insomnia for months you guys might feel really hungry and have difficulty managing food choices. Also the drive to exercise will be hard but once you get into it it’s so important. It’s one of the few things that gets me high like opiates so it’s a staple in my life, I’d even call it a healthy addiction, perks of being an addict in recovery I suppose lol. But my point is sometimes things are really really difficult and the threat of death and misery is what you’re trying to fight against. I’ve lost countless friends and I’m sure you have too just in a less identifiable slow way. Support groups could help, think of picking up a donut like picking up heroin, you never know if it could be your last. The one that takes you back out and does irreparable damage. If you guys say there is 0% chance of having sustainable eating habits paired with exercise, you’re basically saying every opiate addict is going to die from their disease.

I've been advised to titrate off the insulin as I take Ozempic and maybe, just maybe, I will eventually be able to get off the Metformin as well.  IMHO, though, I've always had an insulin resistance, even when I was not overweight, which is what the Metformin helps with, so I'm not so hopeful that Ozempic will help with that.  We'll see!",
          "You can achieve the same results (reducing food noise) by giving up processed carbs and complex sugars.  I was on Ozempic for years for insulin resistance. ( I’m T1D and have Schmidt’s Syndrome). It gave me digestive paralysis and it really changed the taste of food so that I didn’t like the things i used to like.  I was primarily eating crappy processed food & snacks for years but just less of it because I could only eat small snacks and meals throughout the day. I finally decided about 2 months ago to say fuck you to big food and big pharma and give up processed carbs & sugar.  After 4 weeks I gave up Ozempic and haven’t looked back.  I lost weight, I can think more clearly, I’m spending less on pharmaceuticals, and my years and years of depression is gone. I’ve been so much happier!   I admit it took me a looooong time to change the way I eat, I always knew that changing the way i eat would change the way i feel and I thought about it every day for years and years.  I mean, if you really think about it, big food and big pharma are working together to kill us or keep us slow and stupid.  Most of the commercials on tv now are for crappy food and pharmaceuticals!

          "Seriously.  Try the ozempic.  The food noise disappears.  The ability to just stop eating.  To actually feel full is there.  It’s like feeling normal for the first time in my life",
          "Is this how \"normal people\" feel after eating? AKA I started Ozempic. So my doctor prescribed me Ozempic a week ago. It is a once a week injection that does a number of things that add up to a suppressed appetite. It also slows down digestion, so you feel full, longer.  I'm due to take my second shot today.\n\nLeading up to this, I've been eating healthy, lots of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds, proteins, and very little sugars, chips, white breads or other empty calories. No soda or fruit juice at all (maybe 1 or 2 a year). But still couldn't lose any weight.  I maintained at 233 for about 6 months eating that way.  I also have PCOS and hypothyroid, and I'm over 40, so difficulty losing weight is nothing new for me.\n\nThe very first day on Ozempic, my appetite dropped, and all week I've found myself eating about 1/3 of what I ate before and actually feeling full.  This was a revelation.  In hindsight, I don't think I've ever actually felt \"full\" or satiated before. I thought I had, but I was wrong. On occasion, like after Thanksgiving dinner, I've felt \"stuffed\", in that if I ate anything more, I'd throw up, but still, even then, didn't feel what I know now that satiated feels like.  Like my brain was still telling me to go back for another serving, so I still had to use willpower to stop eating.  I was always some level of hungry, even after eating.   The day of my first shot, I made dinner: grilled chicken, and roasted potatoes, asparagus and broccoli.  It is a dinner I have frequently and I usually eat all of what I prepare.  I only ate less than half, and felt a little sick afterwards from overeating.  I ate too much because I didn't recognize the \"full\" feeling as it came on.  After that, I made the connection, and started listening to my body as I ate and stopping sooner. I actually had these \"hunger cues\" I've been hearing about for years and didn't understand.  You can't feel \"hunger cues\" when you are always hungry.\n\nGuys seriously. Is this how normal people feel about food?  I've lost 8.4 pounds in 1 week and never felt hungry other than actual mealtimes.  I have energy, too.  And I haven't had to fight off any cravings at all.  There are chips, chocolate and pizza in my house (my husband is beanpole thin and can eat anything) and I haven't had any desire to eat any of it.  \n\nI previously lost 100 pounds over about 18 or so months.  In that time, while working really hard and constantly depriving myself, and constantly being hungry, I never lost more than 4.2 pounds in a single week (and that was the first week, so some was probably water weight).  This week, I never felt deprived and lost twice as much as my best week ever.  I actually only ever had 2 months I lost more than 8 pounds...in the whole month.  I don't even think much was water weight because I didn't change WHAT I ate this week, only how much of it I ate.  \n\nAND I'm not even on the therapeutic dose yet.  I'm just on the \"get your body used to the medication\" dose.  So far, I've had only very mild side effects in the form of a bit of upset stomach and a lot of burping.  Nothing that would make me stop taking it.\n\nAfter doing a bunch of reading, it appears that this feeling of \"never feeling full\" that I didn't even realize I was experiencing, is likely due to Leptin resistance.  I knew about insulin resistance, but have never heard of Leptin resistance.  Leptin is the hormone that tells your body whether you are underweight and need to eat more, or overweight and need to eat less.  It also helps control metabolism, telling your body when it has reserves and can burn more energy, or when it is starving and should hang on to the fat it has.  It is created by body fat, so the more fat you have, the more leptin you create which is supposed to tell your brain that you don't need to eat as much, but if you are resistant, your brain thinks the leptin isn't there, and keeps telling you to eat more, because it mistakenly thinks you are underweight.  And the current research shows that the main cause of leptin resistance is ... high levels of leptin.  In other words, the simple presence of excess fat makes you  resistant to losing weight.\n\nAll I can say is that it is no wonder that skinny people think heavy people have no willpower.  Their brains actually do tell them to stop eating.  I had no idea.",

And 6 months after stopping i gained half the weight I lost but I did a major overhaul of my lifestyle and lost the gained weight and have continued losing. \n\nThat being said i had to change everything. I watch what i eat ( on a renal diet- thats another story) i run three times a week. I attend zumba twice a week and I do strength training twice a week.  \n\nCame to realize that ozempic just helps kick start the weight loss the rest is changing of lifestyle and eating habits.",

I have felt those same side effects twice but both times I would say it is my fault because I ate waaaay too much due to depression. I have found that for me in order to avoid the constipation and awful gassy burps it's best to not eat anything 13 hrs before and 12 hours after I take the weekly shot. Doing that isn't unreasonable since people do it for medical procedures all the time and I've found that doing that solves 99% of the side effects for me. I'm still a bit nauseous the first 48 hrs after the shot but that nausea prevents me from eating much and I'll take 48 nausea over ending up 70 and 500 lbs unable to move or help myself in a nursing home bed! I'm 28 now and this medicine is literally a life saver and I 100% believe the side effects can be mostly alleviated if you plan your shot and meals around your shot like I did. I know it won't be universal for everyone but as a 28 year old 447lb male, this shot is giving me a chanve to live and fight. And as I lose weight it is easier to exercise and the nausea has trained me to eat less and delete certain food from my dirt because i just can't stomach them anymore!

          "Nothing wrong with using it. Especially where you’re at right now you need to have some success and ozempic can help get you there. There is no such thing as cheating as long as what you are doing is safe and your doctor approves of it - do whatever you need to do.\n\nThere are two important things to be aware of though whenever it comes to Ozempic that I’m not seeing many people here talking about:\n\n1) It’s not magic - you still have to do the work in the kitchen, you still have to learn about nutrition, and you’ll probably still need to track calories. Ozempic is a tool that reduces your hunger - it doesn’t mean you can skip the rest of the process, it just makes the process easier. If you don’t develop the right habits while you’re on it, then you’ll likely gain all the weight back as soon as you get off of it.\n\n2) Be aware of your muscle mass. An issue that seems somewhat common with Ozempic is that some people will take it and cut their calories so low that while they are losing fat, they are also losing a significant amount of muscle mass, which is one of the biggest drivers of the metabolism. You don’t want to end up in a situation where you reach your goal weight but your metabolism is so low that it feels impossible to maintain it. This can be mitigated by taking actions to maintain muscle mass while losing weight, mainly 1) eat lots of protein (aim to eat between 0.6x - 1x your weight in lbs in grams of protein), and 2) do any amount of some form of strength training",

One day 1, just an hour or so after my first shot it was gone, the constant noise in my head that drove me to consume, I didn't even know it was there until it was gone. I actually cried, it was such a surreal feeling. I have asked others about the \"noise\" in their head and no-one knows what I'm talking about except others who struggle with this addiction.  I know you don't want to try OZ but from my experience it is absolutely life changing. And you can stay on a very low dose, I stayed on .5 just to keep the noise at bay and I am easily able to make healthy food choices now.",

          ">I tried to do some research and a few sources recommend cutting out fast food/junk food altogether as that will help the constant cravings and food noise go away if I'm not giving in to them\n\nFor an addict, abstinence never makes the cravings go away, it's just limits the damage from binging the substance of abuse and allows the addict to survive.  Ask any recovering alcoholic- after years of recovery, they're never going to stop thinking about drinking.  This is why you don't focus on the future, you just get through a day at a time without drinking/eating yourself to death.\n\nOzempic is effectively a nauseant. It slows gastric emptying so the food sits in your stomach.  With food in your stomach, the thought of eating more food makes you nauseous.  It's a very painful way of preventing yourself from getting hungry- as is bariatric surgery, but it doesn't remove cravings.  So you  still desperately want that dopamine skyrocketing self medicating junk food fix, but when you try to get that fix, you either throw up, or you want to throw up.  Even if you can endure the nausea and lose weight, research is showing that a lot of the weight you lose is coming from lean body mass, so instead of dying young from obesity, you die young from sarcopenia. Drugs are not the answer.\n\nYou figured out that moderation didn't work with the marijuana.  Moderation might not work with junk food either.  I've been desperately trying to find ways to consume the foods that I love in moderation for years, and, I'm at a point where I can eat a somewhat moderate amount of something and not completely go off the rails, BUT... I get almost no enjoyment from it whatsoever, and am almost always in more pain than if I didn't eat the food at all. It's like unbelievably painful culinary blue balls.\n\nAnd, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but, the classic food addiction isn't just junk food/fast food.  These are the most problematic due to accessibility.  The real problem is high fat with high car",

          "Sharing my real experience with Ozempic. I caught the post yesterday about 'people lying about Ozempic' and was too late to the party to share my experience.\n\nI worked with my doctor last summer and was prescribed Ozempic for weight loss.  At the time, I was 38 yrs old, 6' 2\", and 365lbs and am Male.  At the time, I had just done my annual checkup and all of my blood work was normal - no high A1C, no high cholesterol, sodium, etc etc.\n\nAs a bit of back story to this - In the past, I pretty much would just eat until the food in front of me was gone.  That's what I was taught growing up - eat until your plate is clean.  It's a habit I've struggled with and have yet to overcome.  I don't really know the difference between \"hungry\" and \"not full.\"  For me it's basically \"I'm hungry\" and then \"holy shit I'm so fucking stuffed I could pop.\"\n\nSo last summer, my doc started me on Ozempic at 0.25mg weekly dosage.  I was at this dose for about 3 months and then increased to 0.5mg weekly.\n\nFor the first two months, the change was absolutely un-freaking-believable.  I would sit down to a meal, eat some and actually FEEL FULL.  I was able to easily stop eating with portions of food on my plate and feel completely satisfied.  In those first two months I dropped 15lbs.\n\nIn month three, I was still actually feeling full at meals, snacking between meals less, but the weight wasn't really dropping any longer.  This is why the doc increased me to 0.5mg.\n\nAfter starting the 0.5mg/week dose, this is where it all went downhill, fast.  The side effects came on hard, fast and strong.  If I ate more than say half a sandwich at a meal, I would become so overwhelmingly bloated that I was burping constantly (like literally two big burps every 3 minutes for hours).  On top of that, at this point it made my burps smell and taste so ungodly disgusting (think straight sulfur plus an outhouse at a nascar race in summer at the end of race weekend).  \n\nAdditionally, there were three times in a two week period that I became so bloated that it made me vomit - a lot; and I'm not exaggerating that it was complete projectile vomiting, out of my mouth and nose.  It was an absolutely ungodly horrible experience.  \n\nAs if those side effects weren't bad enough, it also gave me horrible, uncontrollable diarrhea that met the clinical definition of \"severe\".  There were a few days where I couldn't leave the toilet for more than 10-15 minutes at a time.  There was one night I fell asleep on the toilet, because I was so tired from getting up to RUN to the toilet to poo.\n\nAnyways - I stopped taking Ozempic after that experience.  However working with my doc's input, I did stop taking it for just over a month (until my system was back to normal) and then tried the 0.25mg dosage again to see if I still had all of the side effects or not - I did.\n\n \n\nSo the reason to share this is I wanted to put out there my real world experience.  I'm hopefully in the minority of users that get the horrible side effects, and hopefully your experiences will be better than mine.  The key takeaways for me is that I need to learn the difference between \"full\" and \"not hungry\" and stop treating them as the same feeling.  It also taught me that Yes I indeed can actually make it by without snacking, and without eating a bunch of food at every meal.  Hopefully at some point I'll build up better self control and be able to manage that without medication.",

It has been an absolute game changer in managing my blood glucose.\n\nSince my highest weight in 2014, I’ve lost close to 95 pounds, a slow, steady decline over a period of 9 years.   The vast majority of that loss had nothing to do with Ozempic.  My method was to simply keep a good, regular, food diary using the MyFitness app.   Between that and having a glucose monitor, I benefited from information that helped me make better food choices.\n\nI can tell that I’m not as hungry as often the past two years on Ozempic, but the only way it really changed my eating habits was cutting out some snacks.\n\nBy far, the most impactful thing I did was cut back dramatically on alcohol intake.  My two cents.\n\nIf I were to stop Ozempic tomorrow, it would suck for my A1C, but I doubt I would start gaining weight",

It's been really weird for me - I don't feel much less hungry (I have a BIG appetite), BUT what is has been amazing for is acting on my binge eating cravings.  In the past I'd be on plan for 7 days then go on a mad binge - I've always felt a bit like a drug addict when I have a binge urge on, because I feel completely out of control and crazy around food.  Ozempic has stopped that almost completely - it defintitely acts on your brain as well your stomach.  I am down 45lbs in a year (which doesn't sound huge, but I am fully menopausal) and it's enabling me to be compliant with calorie counting, almost 100% of the time.  So the weight I've lost has been through  increasing exercise and a mix of WW and CICO, but it's the Ozempic that's enabled me to stick with it.  The downside is it's costing me £200 a month, but what price do you put on your health?",

Last year it took me months to get my prescription because there was a shortage due to this very reason. And the demand has caused the price of the drug to skyrocket. When my insurance provider changed the pharmacies that they worked with I got a phone call from Walgreens telling me that my out of pocket would be over $3000.00 for a single 2mg pen. Needless to say I cancelled that order and confirmed the pharmacy that would work with my insurance.",

Luckily, I'm currently able to get it at the 0.5mg dose, which is keeping me stable.\n\nAfter some research, I learned that Berberine and Korean Red Ginseng work in a similar way to Ozempic, so I am supplementing my medication with those.

If you have a low thyroid, you need thyroid meds forever.  If you have other chronic diseases, you have to take those meds forever.  Diabetes is a chronic disease.

          "ELI5 - why can't changes on Ozempic (especially for diabetic obesity) be permanent?. Obesity and diabetes/insulin resistance seems to have a positive feedback loop, where the more obese you are the more health problems you start to develop, including diabetes and IR, which in return make you even more likely to be obese. And if you start with diabetes or IR, you're more likely to develop obesity, which then affects your metabolism more, and obesity alone triggers more insulin resistance.\n\nSo if you stop this positive feedback loop by either reducing obesity (and the problems that come with it) or diabetic issues by using medication like Ozempic, this actually seems like the perfect opportunity to reduce the problem and start developing healthy habits that you can keep. I heard that it's easier to cut addictive habits on Ozempic and become more physically active due to more energy, but once you keep doing this to the point it's a habit, you can probably keep the movement going once you're off meds. Your body is used to not craving carbs, get your body used to being slimmer, get used to less appetite and lower blood sugar. It's easier to cut carbs and get used to a low carb diet when you're not craving it all the time and your body got used to low carb. It's easier not feel lethargic at the blood sugar level of 90 if your body is already used to it. It's when you're changing what your body is used to, that's the hard part.\n\nOzempic seems like a great shortcut to start changing your habits. Sort of like a crutch for a broken leg to help it heal, though once your leg heals you no longer need the crutch (crutch is NOT a bad thing, though people use it figuratively as if it is).\n\nAm I wrong? I am not a biologist or a doctor.",

I tried 500mg Metformin though and definitely noticed a reduction in wanting to snack and over-eat. \n\nHas anyone tried both, like me, or knows the science behind the two? I understand they're both prescribed as diabetes drugs but work in different ways. Is RYBELSUS simply better at causing weight loss or does it simply have a better PR team backing it?",
          "While i do agree with you about slimmer people being more likely to be active and therefore more likely to find it easier to stay at a lower weight, i guess what the ozempic doesn’t do is address the person’s reasons for over eating in the first place.

In fact, so crazy-good that the Pharmacist (my doc had me see a pharmacist for prescribing and following me for better T2D control) has only increased my dose to .5ml.  She does not plan to increase it unless my fasting increases to over 130.  Currently, my fasting is around 95-110.  My overall average BG for the past 42 days is 110, which equates to a 5.5 A1C!

          "I agree. It's a great tool. There's nothing like a reduction in appetite to make healthy eating habits easier to maintain. \n\nUnfortunately Ozempic has become today's news cycle wonder drug like Prozac, Valium or Viagra before. There's a high level of popular press and hype, creating misconceptions about how it works and what else is required for success. People who don't understand it assume it's a short cut to the hard work and discipline of healthy eating, a magic pill that melts off pounds by itself and is somehow like cheating. \n\nThe fear of shame is pretty evident by all the posts on various semaglutide subreddits from people just starting and wondering if others have told friends and family, or how to tell them! So sad that people can feel this way, but understandable. For weight loss, we seem to instinctively see medicine as a substitute for effort or admission of defeat. That's similar to how we judge the use of Viagra or antidepressants and mental health drugs.

The upside of a diet like keto, it's in a way a failsafe of just not giving it enough carbs to cause a huge spike, even if there is a spike.\n\nMy concern is more that I seem to be around 100-110 BG fasted these days, with metformin and diet doing all the work.  Would replacing some/all of the metformin with ozempic be a better solution, health wise, would it allow me to drop the remaining weight easier therefore making glucose management easier as well in the long term, even if I don't stay on ozempic in the long term.

It’s lowered A1Cs faster and better than any other diabetes drug out there. One of the side effects is slower gastric emptying and appetite suppression. It changed my life after being a big binge eater. I no longer feel those urges to binge and I’m full quickly. I didn’t see any of that on metformin but my family did.

I haven’t lost much weight but my belly no longer looks like I’m 6 months pregnant and seems to help balance your hormones.

From what I gather, the person you're replying to is talking about weight loss use.   \n\nAs for weight loss. It's correct that if you have an intake of calories lower than the expenditure of calories there would be net weight loss. Energy doesn't appear out of nowhere, so in order to store energy (fat), energy (food) has to be ingested. \n\nWhat you're talking about are disfunction of mechanisms that trigger the body to store energy as fat. Which yes is not ideal, but, it still remains that being in caloric deficit will create weight loss. \n\nThat being said, if the mechanisms you describe are accurate, then it's a great way for diabetics to manage weight gain while also maintaining a proper glucose level. If it's being used solely for weight loss, then yes, it's side effects of creating a caloric deficit via \"tricking\" you into making you less hungry is also how it works.",

There is an overwhelming amount of research that shows that obesity is a multisystemic disease and targeting GLP1 helps in managing a lot of the processes that are working behind the scenes. It helps with insulin resistance (which is common with pcos and weight gain), it helps your body feel fuller longer by slowing down your digestion, which in turn also reduces your appetite. Additionally, no insurance currently allows ozempic off label without meeting the requirements which are high bmi and related weight issues so clearly you must need the drug if your doctor put you on it.",

Also, your insurance almost certainly won't cover it because you are not obese, so do make sure you understand how much it's going to cost. It's not cheap.

Also it can cause a lot of GI side effects.",

GLP-1 agonists (in addition to helping suppress appetite) help your body use insulin properly if you have an issue with insulin resistance. \n\nI used to get extremely hungry in the afternoons. Not normal hungry, famished. I’d eat everything I could find. My doctor did some tests and found out that I have insulin resistance. What this can do is raise your blood glucose levels quickly after eating carbs, followed by a crash in blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). When this happens you will want to eat everything in sight (and you should eat). Since taking Ozempic I haven’t had one of those episodes. There is no guarantee that my insulin resistance will resolve itself once I get to a healthy weight. \n\nInsulin resistance is actually pretty common (between 15.5% - 46.5% of adults, depending on location), but most people wouldn’t know they have it because it’s not typically tested for. Not everyone will feel the effects as extremely as me, but it might come in the form of a very strong craving.",

It def curbed my portion sizes at SOME points but overall was not a gamechanger for me. (At best helped me maintain while on said medication vs typically ppl gain weight.) Now that I'm off the medication, my appetite isn't crazy and I would say I'm eating the same. \n\nI'm also petite and weightloss for me is VERY much about creating a deficit via exercise. Ozempic doesn't really contribute as I'm not someone who gains by overeating. Anyhow it's just my feedback that Ozempic will not be a permanent thing for everyone. I think it will help many but not all. \n\nAlso: I was taking the TESTED 1 mg weekly dose. Many ppl take twice that.

Some people still have terrible habits and continue to eat the wrong foods and lose little or no weight on the medications.\n\nBasically, Ozempic is a great idea if you want to try to lose the weight the old fashioned way (diet and exercise), it just makes it psychologically much, much easier.",
          "The way Ozempic helps with weight loss is as an appetite suppressant.  You just aren't as hungry.  It has nothing to do with how your body uses energy.  \n\nExercise is helpful to losing weight, but is not necessary.  What needs to happen is changing the way you eat.  I respectfully suggest removing the word 'can't' from your vocabulary as it relates to that.  Ozempic is not necessary, and my bias is that it should be the last resort.  It's possible that you are there, but you can definitely lose weight by simply eating less than your body burns.",
          "Ozempic is very dangerous and you WILL regain the weight.",
          "You are absolutely correct that Ozempic helped you with weightloss without lifestyle change because you have PCOS (insulin resistance). The whole reason that ozempic SHOULD be prescribed is for this very purpose.   \n\nOzempic lowers blood sugar levels by mimicking the effects of GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion from the liver. When someone is insulin resistant (PCOS, Diabetes), their body does not recognize when insulin is released and thus does not take glucose out of their blood, causing their blood glucose to spike. A blood glucose spike causes weight gain because it tells your body to start storing glucose as fat. Thus, you are losing weight on Ozempic without changing your lifestyle because your body is properly managing the insulin/glucose relationship and has stopped storing glucose as fat, and you must live a caloric deficit as your regular lifestyle. The reason your lifestyle didn't work before Ozempic was because no matter how little calories you ate, if you ate glucose it would still be stored as fat. \n\nI applaud you on your journey! I bet it really feels amazing to have figured out what was going wrong in your body, and now having it regulated!",

I’m not diabetic (or prediabetic as far as I know), but have struggled with weight my entire life. \n\nI’m currently M, 22, and 245 lbs, but a couple years back, went all the way down to 200 lbs. over the course of 3 years, I’ve gained it back (and more). \n\nMy question: who here has tried Ozempic as a weight loss supplement, and what was your experience after stopping the injections. I don’t want my weight to yo-yo. \n\nCheers!",
          "Sorry, bad choice of words. By \"poorly managed\" I did not mean you were eating sugar or doing things diabetics shouldn't, just that the meds you are taking are not adequate to control your BGL at a safe level without additional insulin. No slight to you was intended. Sometimes our bodies just dont like us. My mother in law is the same way. Does all the right things but could not get the sugar below a 12 (216). She has a terrible doctor and won't listen to me. She just recently got ozempic and has managed to get her numbers under control.\n\nOverall, Ozempic will do the same thing that Metformin will do for your insulin resistance (release insulin in response to food intake) but ozempic will do it better. \n\nMetformin works by telling your pancreas to always be producing more insulin. Ozempic will only tell the pancreas to produce it when you need it. Whether it will cause your pancreas to produce enough to get off insulin? We won't know for a while. Whether you can get off metformin? We'll metformin does have a lot of endothelial health benefits as well so if you don't go off of it, it isn't a bad thing. \n\nSide note: we don't often get tested for insulin resistance (it's not an easy test to do) and we also don't often get tested for insulin levels specifically. Most everything is based off of blood sugar levels. So unless you've done those tests, it is entirely possible you don't produce enough insulin in the first place. Which could be why you need the long lasting insulin to maintain your BGL. It could all be insulin resistance. Or it could be insulin resistance with exhausted beta islet cells.",
          "I see nothing wrong with the drug in any form and it's definitely a tool. The issue I have is when people look to it as their first option for weight loss. There are definitely cases where it should be used as a weight loss aid if other things have not worked. It sounds like you worked things out and with your doctor discovered Ozempic was best for you. \n\nSo, to answer your question I guess, if there is a stigma it may exist because of people who are turning to these drugs to lose weight without trying anything else. I don't know how true that really is, but that's my best guess at any negative perception behind it.",

Personally, it has also improved my mood, because I don’t focus on food so much anymore, which is a huge relief. I also saw a dietician, so I’m making sure I eat enough.",
          "I started Ozempic on May 10, 2022.  My weight was 367 in the office the day it was prescribed.  My wife does Endocrinology, so she is very aware of the side affects I had I had to watch out for.  Her biggest bit of advice was if you feel the slightest bit full, STOP eating.  My first week on it, I went to lunch with a friend and I don’t feel I over ate, but I just have. I think I had a small dinner that night. The next morning, I was puking like crazy.  Thankfully, that is the only time I have. I have had the nasty burps and horrible constipation. That worried me the most, because I have UC and am in remission and don’t want to mess around with that.  As I went up in dosage, I would hit a point that it didn’t feel like the medicine was working. I was constantly hungry, and I wasn’t getting full. I ended up switching to Wegovy, and it’s been good. Total I have lost 68 pounds. I came off b/p medication  a no feel good for the first time.",
          "I’m a 37 year old gay man.  I started Wegovy (which is the weight loss approved version of Ozempic) back in March.  I’ve lost 55 pounds since then.  It has been a complete game changer.  The food noise in my head is just gone.  I don’t spend all day thinking about food anymore.  While I still have to be conscious about what and how much I’m eating, I’m not having to religiously count calories like I have in the past because I can get full on half a burger at a restaurant.  I highly recommend it.  If you are anything like me you aren’t experiencing food cravings like other people who can stay skinny.",
          "Is \"Cheating\" that bad? (Ozempic). \nJust experienced a fallout with a friend because I got prescribed Ozempic to use in tandem with working with a nutritionist and working out. He specifically said I took the easy way out instead of just focusing on nutrition and hitting the gym. My primary reasoning for interest in Ozempic was hearing that it has shown positive signs of aiding in helping fight(if not reverse) Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease(which I have). Not sure if I am in the wrong, but I don't know if my desperation is blinding me to the bigger picture. Thoughts and experiences with this kind of thing would be very appreciated.\n\nEdit:\nFor clarity, diagnoses I have as of now leading to why my endocrinologist prescribed me Ozempic:\n-BMI over 38%\n-Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease\n-Heart Disease\n-Severe Sleep Apnea\n\nEdit 2:\nFor clarity, FtM/31.\n\nEdit 3:\nMy friend is a personal trainer. I was to be training under him with a nutrition plan and gym plan. Ozempic is in tandem WITH nutrition and gym plans. \n\nEdit 4:\nI'm grateful for most folks insight on this. A couple could have been a bit kinder with how their words were put, but I also know that sometimes people feel like tough love is the answer so for that I also thank those commenters for their time and input. I have started the journey with Ozempic, and will be making a lot of notes on how things go as well as documenting all side effects to eventually weigh out the pros and cons. Meal prep day today paired with some podcasts regarding healthier option eating and overall mindfulness. Cracking open a book and going to go hard on figuring out proper macros and serving sizes to build up a plan that follows the guidelines I have been given. Wish everybody well, and thank you again for your time. ",
          "I started ozempic .5 about 3 weeks ago. I had nausea the 1st week or so but now I’m nauseous, sulphur burps, and have no energy. My Dr put me on it because my blood sugar levels where thru the roof. My A1C was a 10.  The way I’m feeling I’m not sure I can keep taking it though. I feel like I’ve got the flu. I’m feeling like shit. Please tell me this goes away!!!!",
          "I've had incredible results with the drug, using it along with a calorie deficit and regular exercise. I went from 242 to 153 as of last Thursday. A few things I'd recommend:\n- WATER! Drink a LOT of it. It'll help with any nausea that you might get, plus most folks just generally aren't as hydrated as they should be anyway.\n- If you're able, start weight training like, yesterday. Unless you're band new at lifting, you're likely not going to put on appreciable muscle mass, but regular resistance training will help you keep what you have.\n- Make sure you calculate your TDEE and eat some number of calories beneath that (500 calories per day below your TDEE will be around a pound of fat lost per week). Ozempic is an amazing tool, but the same rules still apply when trying to lose weight when you weren't using it.\n- Be patient. A lot of folks don't start seeing appreciable results until they've titrated up to the therapeutic dose of 1.0, so if you're not seeing results as fast as you'd like/expect just remember that it's a process.\n- While everyone will respond a little differently, fried and fatty foods tend to be an issue for a lot of folks. Proceed with caution, and start small to test your tolerance.\n- Try not to compare your results to anyone else's. The saying that comparison is the thief of Jay definitely rings true here. The only comparison you should be making is between that person you are today versus that person you were yesterday.\n- You've got this. It won't be easy, it probably won't happen as fast as you want it to happen, and there will be ups and downs along the way, but if you're consistent and always continue to be honest with yourself about your actions, you'll get there.\n\nGood luck!",

Like they really have this calm, this abcense of chatter in their head? ...\", it did make me sad, because up to this point I truly believed I was being undisciplined and somewhat lazy, as of now I think I have some sort of disorder and should have talked to my doctor years ago ....",
          "I’ve been on Ozempic for a week and here’s my take on it and my advice. \n\nIt’s not a miracle drug. You have to make lifestyle changes to lose the weight well on Ozempic. \n\nI’ve lost 3.4 pounds in the first week. I only eat 1000 cal a day and I drink 2 L of water a day. \n\nI drink a smoothie in the morning and two salads and maybe a light snack \n\nif you eat junk food, you will get constipated and get stomach cramps and acid reflex .\n\nI find if I eat, super healthy and drink 2 L of more a day I can go to the washroom just fine .\n\nWhen I was constipated, I took magnesium and it helped me go the washroom .\n\nI took Ozempic Friday night and by Saturday morning I could feel it working. I felt like I was going to puke all of Saturday but now it’s Thursday and I feel like the drug is wearing off. My next shot is tomorrow.",

          "I mean, to be honest, if you’ve been on Ozempic for over a year now and you’ve only lost 19 pounds it doesn’t sound like it was doing all that much for you anyway. \n\nI would focus on calorie counting and making sure you remain in a deficit. What changes to your food intake have you made while on the medication? Try to make a plan to continue and maintain those changes. \n\nExercise is important for your health, but it is not the end-all-be-all of weight loss. You can lose weight without any additional exercise if you’re restricting calories properly.",

There is a part of me that is annoyed that I did something hard and now people are doing it easily and getting the same result. I try my best to silence that voice, but jealousy is human nature.",
          "Restarting my attempt at living healthy at 50 with Ozempic - Everything hurts but also feels awesome.. This is my first post in a long long time here, so long that I can't remember my previous username or email used so starting over in more ways than one it seems.  I've been in a pretty bad place the last few years and gained back all the weight I'd lost during my previous attempt, plus some.  I've felt so defeated, ashamed and just ugh that I'd been struggling to even get motivated to get out of bed and go to work most days.\n\nA visit to my doctor recently and her very harsh words about where I was likely going to end up if I kept going the way I was, coupled with nearly losing my mom due to obesity related issues gave me the smack in the butt I needed it seems to really ratchet up my motivation to get myself under control and to a healthy place.  At that time I was also prescribed Ozempic, due to my T2 Diabetes and obesity.  I knew about this drug of course, who doesn't?  I've read all about the costs and potential side effects and so on.   I also know that expecting this drug to just melt the fat off me isn't the answer, because there's more to living healthy than just being less fat.\n\nSo I started swimming again.  Nothing fancy, just laps, get from one end of the pool to the other by any means necessary, as many times as I can in a 45 minute time span.  At first the leg cramps were unreal, and TOE CRAMPS what the heck is up with that??? Part of the cramping could be due to the new cholesterol med that I also got put on I guess, which apparently can cause that, but waking up after 3 hours sleep with both calf muscles feeling like they are going to tear themselves apart WAS NOT FUN!  That's starting to get better now as I do more.  I haven't been woken with cramps in about a week or so now thank goodness.\n\nI've now upped my work out routine to 8 laps freestyle, 8 laps back stroke, 8 laps freestyle then 15 reps of 4 - 5 different strength exercises with floating dumbells.  ( I don't know who thought of these things but I love them and wish I could hug them ).. Then rinse / repeat until my 45 minutes is up.  I'm also up to consistently going 4 days per week.  I still hurt.  I'm 50, and horribly out of shape.  My knees after standing for 20 minutes feel like I'm being stabbed with an ice pic, but I also know that as I lose the weight that pain will get better just like the cramps did, so in a way I feel like the pain itself is its own motivator if that makes sense?\n\nI'm pretty surprised at how easy its been to change my eating habits with this in mind.  Don't get me wrong I know for sure that Ozempic is playing a big part in limiting my appetite and cravings.  However, I'm also making major changes in WHAT I eat along with how much.  I've gone from eating out 3+ days per week to doing actual MEAL PREP and replacing the junk with things like salad and good proteins and so on.\n\nMy only concern right now is the speed that the weight is coming off.  I've lost 39lbs since I started this and it seems to be speeding up.  This week I lost 5 lbs in 4 days and that seems way too high to me.  Have a doc consult tomorrow to make sure everything is ok, but all in all I feel pretty dang fantastic.\n\nFor anyone who is struggling to exercise I cannot suggest swimming enough.  Lots of local public pools have \"lane swimming\" times, that a lot of people don't seem to know about and at least where I am you can get a pass that gives you access to all the public pools for about $230 / year.  You exercise your whole body, decompress your spine and have pretty much zero impact on the parts of your body that being obese tortures on a daily basis.\n\nReally looking forward to the future, and to extending that future by at least a few years more than my old life would have had.  It feels good to be optimistic again.",

Like instead of a whole packet of chips, serve yourself half the packet and add some cucumber slices and carrot sticks into the bowl - the veggies get coated in errant chip flavouring too, so it still hits the snack craving. Have a cup of soup before meals to fill up, add more salad to your plate. Simple changes.\n\nSee how you go. Just one change at a time. Then increase your deficit a little more. Maybe 300 cal.

          "Hello,\n\nI'm glad you told your story.  I had dark, gloomy thoughts on Ozempic and had a suicide attempt 3 days after I started it on the lowest dose.  .25.  My second suicide attempt was a couple weeks ago.  This one was very bad.  I took 100 pills and was paralyzed for hours. I am lucky after the dizziness was over.  I was ok.   However back on Ozempic I was still angry, moody and had blurred vision.  Even got into an accident with an Amazon truck on a dark, rainy night.  The nausea and Vomiting were the least of the side effects.\n\nI am trying to get the word out of the dangers of Ozempic.   People don't want to believe me or brush it off.  However, I did get several calls from the FDA when they read a review I wrote about Ozempic.   I have gotten  my comments deleted on Reddit.   People don't want to know the truth of this magical Hollywood weight loss shot.   Unfortunately, the more it's hidden, the more people are in the dark and just want to know how wonderful it is to lose weight.",
          "It doesn't work for everyone. Also, you have to start off at a low dose and increase gradually as symptoms subside (doubling once a month at the fastest) until you get to the max dose. A lot of people do lose weight from week one, but based on clinical trials most don't lose until higher doses, which takes a lot of patience. Especially if you are having side effects and also aren't losing weight yet.\n\nWhat happens when you quit? - It's not intended to be something you take and then quit. Ozempic helps treat how your body handles insulin and blood sugar. This helps significantly with mental feelings of hunger that can come from blood sugar and hormone swings, even if you've recently eaten and even if your A1C is fine and you aren't aware that you have insulin/blood sugar problems. If you constantly feel hungry or like you are always thinking of your next meal/snack even when you just ate - this can help you. If you are taking ozempic to treat long term blood sugar issues, obesity, binge eating, NAFLD, etc then quitting it when your weight is healthy is like quitting blood pressure meds because your blood pressure went down. Or quitting insulin as a t2d because your a1c was normal. If your weight gain was from a temporary issue like a med you took in the past or weight gained while you were recovering from an injury, then you can probably? stop and be OK if your previous habits were enough to maintain your weight. But treating a long term condition requires long term treatment, whether that's ozempic or some other similar drug that's out now or in the future.\n\nIt also slows stomach emptying, which keeps you full longer. Which helps with physical cues of hunger. As a note, you have to be aware of this and inform your doctor before surgery as you will need to fast longer than usual before anesthesia. \n\nOzempic is also being studied to treat addiction. We are seeing help with many addictions; including alcohol, drugs, eating, and shopping. Newer studies have seen ozempic",

I expect that they will get better with time, and since I’m doing this for my overall health to lower my A1c, Get rid of my pre-diabetes insulin resistance, lower my cholesterol and hopefully stop the sleep apnea, I’m willing to put up with the side effects.

          "Ozempic shaming. I am shocked how Many posts here shame ozempic users.  Obesity is a disease and like every other disease, support, understanding, sympathy, and encouragement is needed to help the person overcome it.  Not everyone can use the calorie in calories out method for weight loss.  There are metabolic, genetic, mental, and social factors that also continue to plague people even if they are always in a negative caloric state.  Ask any woman who has entered or gone through menopause, anyone who has a brain that does not signal fullness because of a concussion, is on prednisone, or has any of many genes that signal addiction, inability of chemical response to fullness, etc. \n\nTo any of these people, and anyone who struggles with obesity and overweight, this drug is a life line.  To say it is just lack of willpower, learned behaviour and any of the multitude of phrases people use to fat shame, suggest character inadequateness, bad parenting etc, is cruel, short sighted, bullying.  If some misuses it for losing a few cosmetic pounds, the shame is on them and the doctor that prescribed it, not on those who use it so they will not enter morbid obesity, lower their critical medical problems like fatty liver, high AC1, heart disease, and/or addiction to food, alcohol, or drugs.\n\nCongrats if all you have to do to lose weight is eat a more balanced diet in nutritional and caloric value.  That does not help the person who could eat only carrots, salad and protein and keep gaining weight.  The drug is for them, to help them overcome a serious, debilitating disease.\n\nThere is a reddit for those who are considering or are currently on ozempic and other brands of this drug, it is ozempic for weight loss.

Current weight sits between 275 and 285.\n\nTLDR AT BOTTOM \n\nI have been lifelong wideback. Even in the military I was still heavy and found it impossible to lose weight. \n\n\nTwo years ago I was diagnosed with t2 diabetes and have been desperately trying to lose weight, eat better, and keep my a1c/ blood sugar under control. While my numbers aren't super terrible, in conjunction with metformin my endo doc suggested Ozempic about a year ago to help my A1C and weight. I started on the smallest dose, and was titrated to the 2mg dose over the span of 6 months and have been on that dosage for about 6 months.\n\n\nMy gastro issues began almost immediately. First it was frequent trips to the bathroom, which is stated and explained upon beginning the medication and is a normal side effect. After a couple months of being on Ozempic my gastro issues changed, and I was having quite a bit of distress. Frequent burps that tasted slightly alcoholic (i don't really drink) , cramping, stomach pain, upwards of 10 trips to the bathroom a day.  Not normal. I was diagnosed with a H-Pylori infection. For those that don't know, H-Pylori is a bacteria that most of us have. It's very common. Most people have a healthy enough gut system that the bacteria never grows to infection levels and causes any kind of problems, but large enough infection can cause peptic ulcer disease and even stomach cancer.\n\n\nI was on medication for 3 months and had 2 reoccurrences. While my gastro issues and H-Pylori infections were ongoing, I also began to feel more depressed. I have been in therapy and on ssri's for a while since my mothers passing so I felt maybe this was just continued symptoms of that.  Upon beginning the 2 mg dose,  I felt yet another h-pylori infection happening, and my depression seemed to spiral. I began to have frequent suicidal ideation; something I have never experienced before. and if I was a complete wreck. I would get incredibly sad and cry for seemingly no reason, had a hard time wanting to eat because of the fact it would end up in the toilet a few hours later, and just couldn't get my symptoms under control. \n\n\nA week or two ago I stumbled across the article linked below. I read it, and instantly felt that my problems made sense. I asked my therapist to correlate my beginning of the 2MG dose of ozempic and my reports of more severe signs of depression. They coincide within 3 weeks. I showed him the article and he recommended I talk with my Endo doc and discontinue Ozempic. My endo agreed. \n\n\nI have been off Ozempic for 2 weeks. My stomach issues have nearly resolved, and my depression is more than manageable. I feel much more like my old self. While I am more \"snacky\" now and my battle with wanting to eat is far from over, I feel 100X better now. \n\nMy advice is this:\nListen to your body and pay attention to timelines.  If you begin Ozempic or Wegovy, or really anything with semaglutide please pay attention to any side effects. They could be serious and in some cases life threatening. Obese people like myself are already prone to depression AND when we report symptoms to our doctors many times they are brushed off as obesity related issues and not potentially dangerous side effects. Don't be like me and endure these symptoms because you're desperate to lose weight. \n\nTLDR: Was put on Ozempic, this led to decreased ability to fight H-Pylori bacteria, and a severe increase in depression and suicidal ideation. Went off Ozempic and my symptoms are resolving. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eu-probes-novos-weight-loss-drugs-reports-suicide-risks-bloomberg-news-2023-07-10/?utm_source=reddit.com",

          "This is incorrect. Ozempic lowers blood sugar levels by mimicking the effects of GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion from the liver. If you understand science, one reason why someone might gain weight is because their body is insulin resistant (PCOS, Diabetes), their body does not recognize when insulin is released and thus does not take up glucose from their blood, causing their blood glucose to spike. A blood glucose spike causes weight gain because it tells your body to start storing glucose as fat. This process has literally nothing to do with calories, but it explains why many people still gain weight even when they are eating low calorie meals that contain glucose. Thus, the two options for this type of person is to drastically decrease their glucose intake OR to regulate it using Ozempic (or Metformin). Thus, people might be losing weight on Ozempic because it's having their body properly manage the insulin/glucose relationship and they stop storing glucose as fat while you are in a caloric deficit.",
          "Thanks for your question. To answer whether this only related to diabetes: No, it is not just diabetes, as PCOS and/or insulin resistance affects people who are not diabetic. I am talking about weightloss and one of the primary reasons individuals struggle to lose weight.\n\nA large percentage of our population have insulin resistance without diabetes, *see* [https://www.uab.edu/news/research/item/12289-uab-researchers-find-that-40-percent-of-young-american-adults-have-insulin-resistance-and-cardiovascular-risk-factors](https://www.uab.edu/news/research/item/12289-uab-researchers-find-that-40-percent-of-young-american-adults-have-insulin-resistance-and-cardiovascular-risk-factors) . While my insulin resistance is caused by PCOS, for many others it's simply the result of having a poor diet for many years, which creates a chronic disorder outside of the realm of diabetes. \n\nThe fact that someone has not changed their diet at all but is suddenly losing weight with Ozempic is not simply because \"ozempic just makes you feel more full. It doesn't change your metabolism. If these people actually ate at a deficit they would lose weight\" (as the original comment claimed that I in turn commented on). For many, it's because their body is actually using insulin the way it was originally built to be used, but they've been suffering with insulin resistance (again, without being a diabetic). \n\nFor example, as an individual with PCOS my A1C has always been 4, but I have insulin resistance and my body does not process glucose. The doctors have said I'm not diabetic nor even pre-diabetic, yet, I have struggled with carbohydrate weight gain because of insulin resistance. Under medical supervision, unless I ate only 100g of carbohydrates spread out over 3 meals, I would gain weight even at a caloric deficit. This is because my body stored the glucose when it does not recognize the the insulin instead of using it. However a dose of 0.25mg of Semiglutide had a drastic impact on my body bec",

So you know that if you eat less, you will indeed lose weight.\n\nThe struggle of course, is how you'll do that mentally without the medication.  You've likely skipped a few steps that are part of a long-term sustainable medication-free weight loss journey, so you'll need to focus extra hard on those steps: developing habits that work for you and are sustainable and that you can see yourself doing forever - ideally habits that you get some joy out of.\n\nFor example, right now, you're just not really craving junk food, so it's probably been easy to cut out junk food entirely.  When you are not on Ozempic, you'll get a lot of those cravings back.  So the \"cold turkey\" approach may no longer be sustainable - you'll likely need to find some ways to fulfill those cravings now and then without going overboard or feeling like a failure.\n\nThis looks a little different for everybody, because everybody has their own likes and dislikes.  For me, I find potatoes to be a great diet food.  Are potatoes the lowest calorie option?  No!  But they keep me full and satiated in relatively small quantities compared to other foods and I love potatoes and I can also quickly microwave a baked potato so it fulfills that \"convenience\" factor that I'd otherwise often use fast food or take out for (and for me, I find that almost any home-cooked food ends up being better for weight loss - and my wallet - than take out does, so being able to check the \"convenient/fast\" box is important to me).  That's just one example, your ex",

But I am eating small portions and feel SO full after--that's the most discomfort I feel is the unbelievable feeling of fullness!  Due to my fear of the side effects, I did a lot of reading about it--only about 20% experience the nausea.  I felt that 80% of NO nausea are pretty good odds so that encouraged me to jump in.  My 4th injection, I moved up to .5 ml and so far, so good.

Not everyone can and will need a maintenance dose. Diabetics may need to take a maintenance dose as well.

I have a goal to come off all my meds one day, but that remains to be seen. I am a T2D so that’s just life with diabetes in general. But Ozempic was instrumental in helping my body work the way it’s supposed to and I have lost a lot of weight. My side effects were mild and I honestly haven’t had any in months but I eat really well.

Virtually nobody who is taking 1 or 2MG of Ozempic once a week is eating the same amount of calories per day compared to before they are on ozempic.\n\nThe appetite suppressant is a huge deal.

          "Hi! 👋\n\nI'm on Ozempic.\n\nHave been for a few years now. I started on it after getting to my heaviest. That was around two years ago or so, I think? Covid has my timelines effed up.\n\nMy obesity doctor suggested it. I was terrified of it because needles. I take it every week like clockwork. It used to cost me $30 when my insurance covered it. Now it's half a mortgage payment, so I've reduced my dosage to spread it out further.\n\nPeople who talk about serious side-effects are probably on a dosage that is too high. I tell people that whenever they talk about someone they know feeling 'oh so sick'. I feel like a lot of them out there have this obsession with going all the way to the max dosage, and it's really kind of ridiculous.\n\nI started at 0.25, and if that had actually worked, I would have stayed at it. They have you step up, so I went to 0.5 and then 1.0. The max is 2.4 on Ozempic, if I remember correctly, but I've never gone over 1.0, and I've actually stepped back to 0.75/0.80 for the past six months or so, to stretch things out.\n\nThe only side-effects I've had have been feeling full quickly and mild nausea. Ask your doctor for an anti-nausea medication to take as needed, and you'll (hopefully) be golden.\n\nI've lost approximately 100 lbs. My blood sugar is back within normal range, my insulin resistance is normal again (I'm pretty sure 🤔), my blood pressure is doing well, and I don't think I have the beginnings of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease anymore. I think my kidneys have recovered as well from the tiny dip they took for a minute there, too.\n\nI decided back when I first started seeing my slow results that I was going to work out once a week. I was going to get my ass up once a week from my depression nest and work out. So no matter what, I got my ass up and worked out for 30-45 minutes once a week for months. I might very well take my ass right back to the \"safety\" of my bed afterward, but I was going to do what I needed to do to fulfill that tiny promise t",

There is a possibility that the insulin resistance will sort itself out as I lose weight. In that case we can titrate down my dose over time and possibly wean myself off it. \n\nThere is a possibility that I will still be insulin resistant after losing the weight.

          "There are several schools of thought on this. The primary one is that there is no life after Ozempic because it is a lifetime drug. You are meant to be on it forever. \n\nUnfortunately, mostly for financial and insurance reasons, this is not feasible for most people on these medications. In the studies on semaglutide, patients regained a not insignificant amount of weight after the study ended, but it is important to note that they were cut off completely at a high dose with no guidance or plan for maintenance, which is not the recommended way to come off of these meds if you have to. \n\nThe reality is that there’s a lot of buzz about weight gain after Ozempic, but those conversations lack nuance. Weight gain after a period of weight loss happens for most people, upwards of 90%. If you lose weight on a diet and return to your previous habits, of course you’re going to regain weight. The same goes for GLP-1 drugs. It’s not inevitable that if you go off of Ozempic you will regain weight, but you are susceptible to the same pitfalls as anyone else who has lost a significant amount of weight. It’s not necessarily the medication that is responsible for that.",

I'm trying the Ozempic again but my doctor is starting me below the starting dose. And we will NOT go over .05 because it was the 1mg that made me so sick.",
          "Ozempic isn't a magic bullet that will automatically make you lose weight once you're on it - it still works on the basis of eating less and being on a calorie deficit. \n\nIt's just that it's a lot easier to stay in a calorie deficit because there's no more food noise or cravings, and you feel full super easily. And you get turned off fatty, oily and rich foods because you tend to feel sick after eating those. \n\nSo you may still face the same brain fog/anxiety issues when you take Ozempic. It might be worth trying to identify what exactly makes you have those symptoms when you're in a calorie deficit.",
          "I get the impression that I was in the minority, but, it was profoundly unhelpful for me. It gave me a terribly upset stomach, basically all the time. I had acid reflux every night and during quite a lot of the day. I ate about a dozen Tums a day to try to keep that under control. It did help my blood sugar a little bit (I was prescribed it because of type 2 diabetes). My weight dropped about 2%.  \n\nAfter a couple of months I asked my doctor if I could drop it, and he was fine with that. \n\nSince then I've chosen other mechanisms (y'know, eating less and exercise) and they've helped more than Ozempic did, and without the negative side effects.",
          "It sounds like you have a healthy life and mindset!\n\nI don't get what Ozempic has to do with it. Fat people have always been treated differently, and the beauty standards haven't changed since the drug has been available. It just gives a chance to people who struggle to diet.",
          "I'm not on Ozempic exactly but it's like generic Ozempic. But it's not a miracle drug - it slows your digestion, leaving food in the stomach linger so you don't get as hungry. It more do a bit more and mess with hunger signals a little, too, I'm not sure. \n\nI have been taking it since October. I started really low does and didn't notice any change, but the doc had to start me low bc starting high can cause issues. I just did my normal thing and I did end up losing some weight but not a lot the first two months when I was still on lower doses. \n\nOnce I started the higher doses I noticed a difference. At first I still wasn't putting in effort but still losing a few pounds a month. Around the beginning of December I started taking it more seriously, tracking everything, making better choices, and now I'm consistently losing weight. \n\nThis week I was late taking my dose by two days and I did notice a more ramped up hunger then as it really started to leave my system. \n\nIt's just a tool. It helps me a lot to get a handle on how hungry I feel. I am able to say no to snacks and sugary drinks I would have been desperate for before. Some of that is just because I am actively trying to make the better choices in what I'm eating. \n\nYou've still got to put all the same work in as you would otherwise, but for me it's like an extra boost. I'm doing this because I have a goal and to get to that goal, I've got to change myself. I haven't gone off it yet but I do think that once I've grown used to only eating so much it will help with the hunger issue. \n\nSo if you're looking for something that's going to magically melt the weight off, this isn't it. But it is a handy tool to have if you can get it - like going from a push mower to a riding mower. Both get the job done, but the right equipment makes it a lot easier.",
          "Its a scam attempting to lighten your wallet.   \n\n>Nature’s Ozempic\n\nis a nonsense phrase that has zero meaning, and is designed to try and hitch their bandwagon onto a popular medication.",
          "I really appreciate reading stories and updates from others taking Ozempic. I’ve been on Ozempic for about 7 months and I’m down 45. According to my doctor it’s 55 but I’ll go by my scale at home. For the first time in my adult life I’m not always hungry. And that’s been a game changer. My insurance plan won’t cover despite my doctors insistence that it’s medically needed due to my BMI.  The side effects of been no joke, but I’ve learned to (mostly) manage them by making better choices. Smaller meals, much less fat, less sugar and NOT fasting all day then eating a normal meal. And I keep gravol on hand for those few days after my injection (0.75 now) as that’s when I’m most likely to be nauseated. Ozempic has definitely changed my relationship with food for the better. I eat 1/2 as much at meals and when ordering in or going out. And a preemptive note for those who might lecture me on diet & exercise blah blah. Gee, what makes you think I HAVEN’T tried those things??\n\nUpdate - I corrected to say MOSTLY manage because some days are still a “crap shoot” for managing side effects. Yes, pun intended.",
          "Give the Ozempic a try. I know there’s a stigma but it is seriously a miracle drug.",
          "Mechanism for the weight loss doesn't change if you use Ozempic or not. You eat less.\n\nA months supply of Ozempic (if you can get it) costs 112 € in my country. I can save a lot of money if I eat only as much food as I need and don't use Ozempic. At least a fifth of the rent each month.",
          "Ozempic not working. Hi\n\nI been on ozempic for weight loss for over a year. I lost 30 pounds and still have a long way to go.\n\nA few months ago ozempic just stopped working. I had my doctor up my dose twice to the maximum 2.0 mg. It's still not working. I feel like the drug isn't real but bought it from a big pharmacy.\n\nMy doctor tried prescribing me contrave but i had an allergic reaction. No other drugs available for weight loss in canada.\n\nI got a script for mounjaro but insurance won't cover plus shortages. I feel really bad right now as I just finished binging and gained 5 pounds in 2 weeks.\n\nI even tried splitting the dose in 2, but I feel like I'm immune.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",
          "Experience with ozempic?. Does anyone who’s non-diabetic have experience taking ozempic to aid in weight loss? After I lost the initial 40ish lbs I just have plateaued for a while and I can’t seem to get past it.  My bmi is still hovering around 32.  I do my best with food (I graze during the day and then eat usually a reasonable meal for dinner) without restricting and going back to binging because of it.  But I have physical limitations due to back problems, joint problems and I’m having issues with my heart rate as I continue to push myself with exercise.  So I’m kind of stuck in this weird place and it’s super discouraging.  My doctor brought it up when I expressed these concerns and I’m curious what experiences anyone else has had with it.",
          "For sure. I know nothing happens over night. I’m just more concerned about the fact that I still have an appetite and can binge with 0 side effects from the ozempic",
          "Ozempic has been a wonder drug for me, but given our similar story, I would warn you about some things. \n\nWhile I’m on it, Ozempic cuts my interest in food down to nothing. When I go off it, the food noise and intense desire to eat comes back. I have gained five pounds a week back when I’ve taken a break from the medication, because the physical cues that tell me I’m full aren’t there. There are still foods I can’t keep in my apartment. That makes me worried for when and if I do hit my goal weight. I really need to find a competent therapist who treats people with binge eating disorder. \n\nOzempic has also been miserable for me. Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pains are a regular occurrence.",

Life has a way of making things worth achieving very difficult and with no easy ways around it.\nHowever, there has been a new drug announcement that is promising in terms of supporting weight loss. It is supposed to help the metabolism stay high and avoid starvation mode.( which does such BAD!!!!)",
          "I’ve used MJ to assist. From day one, my routine changed. I stopped drinking. I ate healthier foods. I exercised heavily 4x a week. I ate drastically less. \n\nThe medicine is a tool that primarily increases satiety, meaning I get full faster. I don’t consider it cheating, because I still make smart decisions. Many of the things I do were learned from this sub and others. \n\nI truly hope it becomes more accessible as time passes. Patients should not have to worry about diabetics not getting it. It drastically improves the lives of both diabetics and those trying to avoid being diabetic.",
          "Reading around, it seems its a useful drug in small doses to give you a leg up in a short time frame, so afterwards you can undertake weight loss on your own regiment without the drug. More than that, and it's more harmful than useful.",

It’s the same drug but on-label for weight loss not diabetes. \n\nI still need to meal plan and count calories but the difference is that with this drug I can actually stick to the plan and I’ve been losing weight steadily. \n\nSome people cannot come off the drug without gaining weight so consider if you’re willing to make a long term commitment before you start.",

That is me and everyone is different, keep in mind they will generally start you on quite a low dose, 0.25ml I believe I started on, and even this made a massive impact in my hunger levels.\n\nI see the risk of these side effects as balancing out for the extra strain my heart has to go through with being obese and the other health issues this causes. I expect that I will only need to be on this for less than 2 years and there is no way I could lose this much weight over this timeframe without it.\n\nOne thing I should have mentioned in my post is most days I am consuming around 800 calories total, without any will power",

It's really hard sometimes because a lot of people DO think this is a magic shot, which to them means we don't still have to put the work in.

Taking the meds is fine, it’s more the logistics of it (like you said, insurance et al). I’m experiencing some negative side effects from long term med usage so I’ve become much more concerned about potential side effects from *any* medication meant to be used long term.",
          "It’s odd that everyone keeps commenting “you’ll gain it back if you stop taking it.” \n\nThey probably will, but data shows that 80-90% of people will regain all of their weight loss within a couple of years of losing it with traditional weight loss methods anyway (without these drugs). \n\nIf this helps people get to a healthy weight, good for them.",

In canada, at least, it can be prescribed for weight loss in individuals with a weight related comorbidity, not just diabetes. I also know that it is commonly used as a bridge to bariatric surgery given the long weight times. The main issue I see with it is that the weight WILL return if you stop taking the medication. So, if you dont need to take it, or if you arent taking it with the intention of using it as a bridge, its probably better to lose the weight without it. This is just on the basis of it being less temporary and avoiding side effects. \n\nBut ultimately, it is no more cheating than taking thiazides or beta blockers are cheating for lowering your blood pressure.",
          "I was on Wegovy (same ingredient) till the shortage, and i have been off of it since July. I continued losing about 10lbs after stopping, and have maintained since. It depends on individual commitment. The drug makes you more aware of when you need to stop eating - when enough is enough. You can choose to listen to it and form a habit around that information or not. If you expect the drug to do the work for you, it’s not going to work. But it absolutely makes losing weight easier.",
          "It might seem daunting but try to think positive. You’ve done a tremendous job so far!! I’m curious where you got the 2/3 statistic from. That number was loosely thrown around when talking about people who had weight loss surgery but I haven’t seen anything regarding the newer drugs. I also know several people who took it for 6-9 months to help with weight loss, weaned off it, and have continued to lose over the last 3-6 months.",
          "Well, drugs in this class do have other effects on glucagon, insulin, etc. So it's not quite that simple, especially in the context of things like insulin resistance (which is common in obesity.)\n\nUltimately the net effect is eating fewer calories than you burn, but... the majority of obese people can't do that long-term without medication or surgery.\n\nIf you *can* then, sure, you'd lose weight.",
          "It works. It won’t do all the work for you but it works. According to the ozempic website, the average weight loss is only 12-14 lbs (last time I checked) so you’ll have to put in the work to maximize benefits, and if you get off of it, you’ll slowly regain the weight. It can be prevented but weight loss will feel like another full time job again if you do.",

          "To be fair I only used it for about two weeks",
          "In and of itself, some weight loss before your surgery probably would be a good thing. I think the thing to be more concerned about here is whether there might be problems with negative interactions between this drug and other drugs involved in your surgery.\n\nOr other problems along those lines that might not be obvious to a layperson (for example - and I don’t know anything about this drug in particular, so I’m just making this up - if the drug temporarily suppresses certain hormones or bodily processes that you want to be acting normally for a good recovery from surgery).\n\nI see from your other comment that your GP is not really someone you want to talk to about it, but I think that ideally you would probably want to ask your surgeon anyway, rather than a GP. Maybe you can reach out to the surgeon’s office?  (Edited to add - or talk to an obesity doc, like u/SDJellyBean said - someone like that should be able to give really good advice.)\n\nAlso, this is definitely a scary situation and it’s totally understandable to be really stressed about it - anyone would be.

          "I’ve only been on it for like 6-7 days and I want to cry. I have a normal size meal and feel full. It’s now late night for me, which is when I’d usually start scrounging for another snack and I have no desire to. Why wasn’t I given this sooner??",
          "and remember that the people that ARE on it are not all using it for a “quick fix.” I’ve been trying to lose weight for YEARS and due to natural insulin resistance, could not. I personally don’t lie but I don’t recommend it for everyone since it’s not worth it for everyone. I’m grateful for it but wouldn’t say it’s worth it for people that have good functioning endocrinology. And no matter what, comparing your journey to others is never good. It doesn’t help you. Stay on your own track and you’ll be good! Finding what works for you is key",

          "You’ll need a prescription. Also, depending on where you live they will enroll you in a problem that has weekly nutritionist check ins/therapy/drs appointments. Also read up on side effects and stuff. It’s absolutely not a quick fix or a miracle drug",

The day of my finals I'll be back on the weightloss journey that helped me to lose 50lbs. Several yrs ago pre baby. Kinda excited. I do have loose bowels and and overall quesy feeling. But to call it diarrhea when I only poop once a day would be inaccurate. My doctor said to up the dose to  .5 after 2 weeks.   But I don't think I'm going to. I'm going to keep it at .25 until my body is use to it. Regardless if it helps me lose weight or not. Honestly all I really needed is to not crave sugar everyday.  I don't mind putting in the work . My previous workout routine was  15k step a day. 500 kcal burned fasted in the am seperate from walking. One upper day and one lower day  using all muscle groups so my body will be more willing to burn fat instead of muscle.",

          "I know this may not help much, but you don’t know if it would even help with your weight loss. I know of 2 people on this medication and they lost maybe 5lbs but the other person gained it all back apparently. There’s also posts about stating they haven’t lost weight at all or even gained. This is not a guarantee. You do have a guarantee of weight loss with exercise and diet though ! Which is great news and a good reason to keep going",
          "That makes sense. It’ll be interesting to see long term how these meds evolve and obesity gets more and more treated like a disease how usage will change. And see what long term effects happen after being on these meds for long periods of time. Looking forward to that data! \n\nI’m not anti med (I have a chronic autoimmune disease so I’ll be medicated in some fashion for the rest of my life) but it’s bc of that I would like to limit what meds I’m on.

Also yes. \n\nUse it as a crutch to change your relationship with food. Continue to read labels and see what you’re consuming. Change your habits for the better and the weight will stay off.",

          "I wish people understood better how these meds actually work. When *naturally thin* people tell you to just have **more willpower**, they don't know what is going on in our bodies or brains. They don't eat 5 cookies because they only wanted 1, whereas my brain tells me I have to eat them all. Obesity is a disease and this medication helps mitigate it. Being on this medication isn't a *magic potion* that makes me lose my appetite. It **does** balance my hormones and insulin to allow my body to function the way a *normal/naturally thin* persons body would function.",

Since then, no headache, but occasional low blood sugar, which is easily taken care of with a few crackers. \n\nIt is really helping me to come to grips with my habit of boredom / stress eating. It's easier to say no, or to stop eating much, much sooner than I have in the past.",

Wegovy and Saxenda (the \"on label for obesity\" versions) are both labeled for indefinite use, including maintenance. \n\nHere's one example: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777886 https://www.novomedlink.com/content/dam/wegovy/images/charts/step-4/step-4-primary-endpoint-chart.png Even with monthly counseling visits, a prescribed 500 calorie deficit, instruction on exercise, and daily logging on the patient's part that was reviewed monthly- the people who stopped taking the drugs on average substantially regained. \n\nhttps://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tirzepatide-demonstrated-significant-and-superior-weight-loss (the actual research isn't published yet, I believe?) Only patients who demonstrated the ability to initially lose 5% or more in a 12-week drug-free lead in period (with weekly counselling, diet and exercise instructions) moved to the next stage (placebo or meds.) \"Those taking tirzepatide, on average, lost an additional 18.4% of their body weight from randomization compared to those taking placebo who experienced mean weight regain of 2.5% over 72 weeks. In addition, 87.5% of those taking tirzepatide achieved an additional ≥5% body weight reduction from randomization compared with 16.5% in the placebo group over 72 weeks\"\n\nLike blood pressure or cholesterol pills or any number of other medications used for chronic conditions, they *don't work if you stop taking them.* \n\nThere's an common narrative among some patients, and unfortunately some providers that if people \"use the time to learn\" and \"build better habits\" or whatever, they're going to keep the weight off.

For some it may not do much depending on their diet and habits.\n\nIt's not a magic bullet even if it's helpful. \n\nI agree that a lot of people are taking it to lose a few pounds in a way that seems ill-advised and low-key lazy.... But overall, it's also not a drug that is doing anything different for diabetics. It's helping them mostly by helping them eat less. It still requires diet. \n\nOr in my case, I take it to counteract a serious medication that causes weight gain. My doctors are really happy bc most ppl gain a lot on it.

It is really upsetting that diabetics are having a hard time getting the medication because it really brought my A1c down to a more manageable level. \n\nThose people who use it to just lose weight should start thinking about what will happen when they are off. I personally cannot wait to stop using.",

          "Since starting this myself, I’ve let exactly the same way. I think this drug has the ability to change lives and the negative discourse around it needs to stop. What I do with my body doesn’t just stop at abortion. It also means that I have the power to make whatever choices I what and if that means taking a weight loss drug to help me, then so be it. \n\nThey way it’s changed my relationship with not only food but also alcohol has been life-changing if we can harness that for people who struggle with addiction and smoking cessation than the naysayers can shove it. :)",
          "Medication and surgery alone do not change peoples eating habits or disordered eating. So say a person starts Wegovy and loses 100lbs. This medication has seriously reduced their appetite but hasn’t changed how or what this person eats, just how much.\n\nIf they stop the medication, that appetite suppression is gone and they haven’t built eating habits and tools to maintain this new weight. So they will regain. This is the same with folks who diet until they hit their goal weight and folks who get gastric bypass.\n\nBut if the person has also been working in healthier eating habits, they may be able to maintain if they stop medication. But medication cannot change habits.",
          "Hi there! Perhaps a medical professional would be bets to guide you on whether there may be any interaction between those drugs and whatever you have to take before, after and during your surgery? \n\nI think that would be my biggest concern. Wishing you all the best for your surgery and your weight loss!",

          "I plan on taking this or the next better thing indefinitely. There is a 0% chance personally I'd maintain this loss off meds, and the other physical/mental health benefits are far too significant for me. \n\nOf course you should discuss your options with your doctor and some people are exceptions, but in *general* with every anti-obesity medicine currently available, results aren't generally super durable if you stop the meds.",
          "I was on .25mg for 4 weeks, and I am currently on .5mg for a second week. I didn't notice much in my appetite curbing while on .25mg. However, when I started on .5mg, I noticed it maybe a couple days after my first shot. \n\nNow I am on my second week of .5mg, and the food noise is definitely quieter. I still get hungry, but I dont constantly think of food or need to overeat to feel full. The cravings have lessened, so it is easier for me to choose healthier options. I am just starting, but I do notice a difference.",
          "What dose are you using for weight loss?\nMy doc prescribed 2 times a day 500mg",
          "My endocrinologist explained part of the reason I gained it all back is because I didn’t build muscle while I was on it to help use up the extra calories when stopping. I consider it a trap and never want to use it again. I’m now twenty lbs heavier than when I first tried it.",
          "I think Retatrutide in particular has a heightened-metabolism effect (because of glucagon, like you said).\n\nAlso, I’m wondering if you’ve considered tapering off but slowly to see if the effects stay with you? Not moralizing use of the drug, but from a practicality standpoint I know that an *effective* taper would be highly desirable. I’ve seen some people talk about using these drugs to eventually reach a new “set point” where their body believes their new lower weight is the “right one” so the hunger doesn’t come back. Not sure if you have any thoughts on that.",
          "Great post, thanks. \n\nHow in the fuck does weed motivate you to lift though? Sativa or indica, it doesn't matter.  I sleep. Well, as it turns out, but still, I just want to sleep. If there's a magic weed out there that will make me lift better, please,  do tell!",

          "The only issue I have with people taking the drug for weight loss is there were other people taking the drug for its original prescribed reason who are now struggling to get it.

          "Which symptoms, if you don’t mind sharing?",
          "I have lost 70 lbs on Wegovy/Ozempic with maybe 5 lbs to go. Technically I’m at my goal but I’d like a 5 lb buffer. Total weight loss is 95 lbs so far because I had lost 25 lbs on my own before starting the medication. \n\nThe research is clear - most people regain significant weight if they stop taking it. \n\nI will be on this drug (or something similar) for the rest of my life. I lost 110 lbs once before and gained it back - I know I am not capable of maintaining my goal weight without this support.",
          "I feel 100% better. It took about 2 weeks before I saw a full remission of symptoms but I feel like my old self. You should start feeling better within a few more days.",
          "Weight loss drugs are so complicated.  They exist, they work for a lot of people, and they deserve to be talked about.\n\nThe  medications are not a magic pill.  You can overeat on them.  You can binge on them.  They don't work for everyone.  The average weight loss is like 4% on the injections, and about 5% on the appetite suppressants, as someone else mentioned, the wild success stories are the only ones getting airtime and those are the outliers, not the average.  The side effects are serious, there's a major risk analysis needed, like with the surgeries.  I take that risk because my BMI was 42.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am personally morally opposed to Ozempic, and the versions made by the same manufacturer under different names, because of the shortages it's causing for diabetics.  But, there are other drugs that were created to treat obesity, and that's their only purpose, and so I use Qsymia.  I only started it after losing half of my current weight loss on my own, after a lot of talks with my doctor, and my brain med prescriber, and research online.  I was in therapy both for my mental health, and for my BED.  I had been increasing my activity and changing my cooking habits for 7 months.\n\nIt has been absolutely LIFE CHANGING for me.  With the caveat that I've also gotten a lot of therapy, as mentioned. \n\nI was always hungry.  Always.  No matter how much I tried to cut calories, I could not, I couldn't do it, not for more than a week or two.  My internal voice was that I was a fat, worthless, lazy, piece of shit failure.  I could eat 2000 calories and my stomach would start growling 20 minutes later.  I could 4000 calories, and still be hungry.  I could eat 6000 calories, and still \\*want more food\\* despite being physically in pain from eating so much, but I was not satisfied.  I was losing weight without the drugs, but I was literally going to sleep with my stomach growling every night, crying myself to sleep, it was so utterly awful and I knew I wasn't going to be abl",
          "Scientific answer is phentermine along with therapy. Larger dose on the therapy side. You need to understand the WHY of not having control. If you’re able to process and really learn new habits, then it works. Otherwise you’ll gain the weight back as soon as you stop the pill. It takes a lot of work but you can do it!",
          "Because the person is actually doing the right things on their own to lose weight, why exactly is a boost needed from a primarily diabetic drug? OP, I’m sorry by why even consider these at all?",
          "I think so! You start out at a low dose to get your body used to it and it will take some time for it to build up in your body. Keep at it :)",
          "It works, but there are side effects and most people do regain a significant amount of weight if they stop taking it.\n\nThe rapid muscle loss and changes to intestinal health are the biggest concerns - I’m hoping these drugs are a stepping stone to better drugs.",
          "Stick to your doctor's advice, not us bozos on the internet.\n\nThat said, I do know enough about food to tell you that sustained weight loss will come from diet composition. If you keep eating the same things as before (particularly carb-heavy dishes that do not satiate and lead to frequent snacking in between meals), you will slowly regain every last pound that the pill removed.",
          "(I made up the hormone example, but not out of whole cloth…I know when I was taking Tamoxifen and I had a surgery scheduled, the surgeon asked me to stop taking it for while before + after the surgery.  This is a real concern - it might well be fine to take this drug beforehand, but please do talk to someone first - doesn’t have to be your GP.)",
          "Definitely talk to your doctor about it. I have had huge benefits from medication, not only weight loss.",

          "My worry is long term do we know that it is safe. Sure its safer than obesity or diabetes, but what about for someone that is just 10-20% over the overweight line? Obviously if it prevents you from being 200lbs when healthy is 130 that is good, but I'm wondering about some people get on it to go from like 230lbs and stop at 200lbs - still overweight but still on the meds. Also it can impact many physical activities you might want to do at a healthy weight, like fuel properly for an endurance sport.\n\nThere isn't much of a debate if you stop taking it that you gain the weight back, I have seen it happen to my mother-in-law and [studies have been done](https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.14725). \n\nI think it is good that people can have access to life saving medicines, but I don't think it is bad to question them when they haven't been out and commonly used for a long time(like 30+ years). For you it sounds like a very black and white positive result and I'm curious how common that will end up being with the general population.",
          "I was on it for 3 months. First 2 months ramping up in dose, no side effects no weight loss. Last month nausea, vomiting, diarrhea all day every day.  Still didn't lose any weight.

Also im happy that a doctor is finally looking into some of my concerns.",

          "You can also consider a medical program that believes in continuing these medicines for maintenance. joinmochi or the new weight watchers program, etc. \n\nUnfortunately, research has shown so far in every study that weight begins to go up almost immediately after stopping these medications. (Even when it’s placebo and they don’t know it stopped). You might be in the small minority who can maintain it without medicine but don’t shame or blame yourself at all if you can’t. \n\nI’m taking tirzepatide and plan to continue for a minimum of 1 year AFTER reaching my goal weight, even paying the cash price. ($150-400 per month depending on which program and which medication).",
          "Seeing as you already had good habits for your health/fitness , maybe see if your doctor will prescribe you bupropion.

But, the whole time she was allergic to dairy and other weird things. I've heard other people say the same happened to them, or they lost the ability to digest red meat on various liraglutide/semaglutide injections.\n\nNot saying everyone would have those reactions, but its a thing. It's worth trying at least, it seems like my ex-wife can slowly digest dairy again now that she stopped taking it. Navigating life staying away from dairy was an experience for both of us.",

I’ve tried other weight loss drugs (like Metformin) and they didn’t do a damn thing in comparison. \n\nI will say you still have to work on your diet while taking it.

          "Are tiktokers lying?. I've gotten a lot of advice saying that the weight loss community on tiktok is pretty positive, especially if you share your journey. It's also free compared to the $200/month fitness classes I go too. I'm also being considered for Wegovy. I had to log my diet and exercise for 3 months to get approved. But my blood work came back as severely anemic so things are still up in the air \n\nI'm almost 30 and Ive never used tiktok. But I see a lot of \"what I eat in a day as someone who lost 90lbs in 4 months no exercise no diet\" videos. And it's full of meals, Mac n cheese, snacks. And when comments point out there's no way you ate that much and lost weight, there's a \"you should always feed your body\" response.\n\nAnd I get it. But, either these people or 8 feet tall or severely exaggerating. Most are healthy diets that *could* lead to weight loss but not to the extreme degree that they are claiming. 50lbs-100lbs down in months doesn't seem realistic, especially not with the meals they are showing.\n\nPersonally, I eat 1200 calories a day. I've lost 15lbs in 3 months. And I'm 4'10. So maybe my perspective is screwed on how much the average human should eat. But even if I eventually get weight loss medication, hundreds of lbs a month is still not realistic\n\nIt's just so strange to see all these people say they lost hundreds in a short period with no loose skin while eating so much. Are the most viral videos lies? Is it any of it real? People lie on the internet all the time. But for this in particular, what motivation do they have to do this?",

That is success for them. \n\nAlways consider- \"what is this person's motivation\" when taking information from social media. But in my experience, of all social media, tik tok is the worst. People who have no experience or credentials are on there telling stories that have no factual basis. Some credentialed people are on there too, but the majority is junk.",

          "Extreme results tend to get extreme attention/views. \n\nDieting isn’t sexy. \n\nDieting isn’t always fun. \n\nDieting doesn’t draw a lot of attention. \n\nResults do. So people exaggerate their results and attempt to make the process look more fun, more enjoyable. So influencers do this to get more attention, more likes, more engagement, more money, blah blah blah. And sure maybe some of those claims are true. But I know a lot of them aren’t. \n\nfocusing on the outside world/influence to base your journey/results tends to lead to a lot of frustration in the comparison. Find a plan and support system that works well for you and yields results. Ignore everything else. Instagram and TikTok is a highlight reel of the best generally speaking, and ignore the bland, boring and consistency of dieting. (In my biased opinion as a nutrition and strength coach).",
          "TikTok, like many other social media platforms, is not regulated for validity and accuracy, and relies heavily on trusting anonymous sources online to provide you with the best counsel. Always verify everything you're hearing about fitness and wellness with scientific research, that goes for everything.\n\nThat being said, there is a lot of truth to what you're seeing and a lot of fallacy. You can lose weight purely through diet, and a lot of these 'eat this not this' content producers are providing quality healthy replacements for junk food that substantially lower the calories, or increase the healthy macronutrients like protein. There's also a lot of body positivity that can be found on Tik Tok, as well as the exact opposite, if your algorithm notices a lot of activity from you on the former, it'll show more of the former. People like JoeySwoll have done a lot to try and promote better gym etiquette and body positivity which is excellent.\n\nI would lean into TikTok primarily for recipe swaps and suggestions rather than exercise content unless they openly use scientific papers/studies, or have a degree in nutrition, physiology, or a similar related field that would provide a level of validity. There are a couple of guys I remember getting shown that would debunk popular myths on social media, or debunk nutritional scare videos, and they were really cool and informative, but unfortunately that's two or three guys in a sea of thousands upon thousands of influencers trying to get you to do this targeted butt workout, or buy these expensive supplements and tummy shrinking tea.",

You can't assume that your body works the same way or burns the exact same amount of calories as anyone else. \n\nThe BMR and TDEE numbers online are a good place to start, but if you find you are eating 500-1000 calories under that number and still not losing weight, you have to recalculate for your own body. \n\nThis person obviously has a very low TDEE because of how their body works and wasn't adjusting for their personal experiences.",
          "I agree, but your healthy habits along with CICO are leading to sustained weight loss, not CICO, exclusively. \n\nFor some people, CICO means eating cereal for breakfast, a burger with fries for lunch, then having a couple beers at dinner and fasting the rest of the day.  Maybe they pop a multivitamin. I see a lot of them here on this sub.  This was how I “dieted” as a teenager.  Obviously it’s a sure path to rebound weight gain and yo-yo dieting.  \n\nIt sounds like you’re doing everything right, even through some true difficulty.  Congratulations.",
          "with cico you lose weight without exercise.",
          "Well said, calorie counting has 100% allowed my crazy brain to just trust in this process. Tracking calories has removed the chaos and drama around food and the scale as well. CICO might not be for everyone but it’s been so helpful for me as a hardcore life-long emotional eater. And that doesn’t just mean sobbing over Ben & Jerrys when life hits you. Cumulative years of wandering to the pantry and eating whatever/whenever I “feel” like it got me up over 200 lbs. \n\nOf course I’ve had my handful of “eff it” days over the last 3 years but CICO has always brought me back to mindfulness being my default habit.",
          "What is CICO?",
          "The most effective way to do this and also to set yourself up to keep it off is to both eat less and exercise.\n\nStep 1: Lose the weight - Eat less and exercise more  \nStep 2: Keep it off - Eat normal and exercise normal\n\nYou can do a food only diet (which is not CICO) as some here are suggesting, but you will just gain it back again. You can't diet forever. The trick is to lose the weight and raise your level of activity enough so that you can go back to eating normal and not gain the weight again. The CO in CICO literally means exercise.\n\nThe ACSM puts it best ...\n\n[Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (health.gov)](https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf)\n\n \"People who are at a healthy body weight, but slowly gaining weight, can either gradually increase their level of physical activity (toward the equivalent of 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity) or reduce caloric intake, or both, until their weight is stable. That is, by regularly checking body weight, people can fnd the amount of physical activity that works for them.\"\n\n\"Many adults will need to do more than the 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to lose weight or keep it off. These adults should do more physical activity and/or further reduce their caloric intake. Some people will need to do the equivalent of 300 or more minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week to meet their body-weight goals. In addition to restricting caloric intake, these adults should gradually increase minutes or the intensity of aerobic physical activity, to the point at which the physical activity is effective in achieving a healthy weight.\"\n\nYour situation is realtively easy. I would walk briskly an hour a day (or two 30 minute walks). Eat at a deficit of 500 cals, lose the 20 lbs in 16 to 18 weeks, and then keep some of the walking as a regular part of your day. You will then be at your target wei",
          "After a month or so of strict CICO, *no cheat days*, my appetite had gotten easier to manage. By month 2 it felt like I had permanently adjusted my appetite from around 3200+cals a day to 1800-2000. It's like I had gotten a completely free gastric sleeve surgery.\n\nSo yeah, it can definitely get much easier.",
          "My understanding is that human metabolism is a bit more complicated than CICO. I'm not saying to disregard CICO, it's a good approximation most of the time, but it may be off in the case of such medical issues.\n\nIn particular when people say they're exhausted and gaining weight, it seems that the pathway that changes food into energy for physical activity doesn't work well, and the energy has to go somewhere, so it gets stored as fat.",

          "CICO isn't long term sustainable if it's approached as a diet that has a start and end point, and then you win!  You're done forever!  You did it!  Yay!\n\nMaking long term sustainable, manageable, lasting changes to the way that you approach food, and health, forever, is the only way that ANY kind of weight loss is \"sustainable\".  \n\n\\[Insert your favorite fad diet here\\] will probably work to drop pounds for a few months.  \n\nAbsolutely none of them are going to be sustainable if you don't change your entire LIFE when it comes to food, if you are an obese person.  That's not to be all doom and gloom, it's just facts.",
          "I don’t think there is anything wrong with using whatever you need to lose weight but lying about it is not cool. \n\nI’m in my 40’s and my personal philosophy is that there is no magic bullet for weight loss. And by that I mean, there is no substitute for learning to eat the right way, CICO and exercise. Other things might help people lose weight but the only permanent, sustainable solution is tracking your calories and eating less than you burn to lose weight. It’s not fast or easy but it’s definitely doable and worth doing.",
          "I watched a video once that opened my eyes: We're carbon based life forms. It's all about carbon atoms in vs carbon atoms out. So of course CICO works because if you take in less carbon atoms than your body needs for energy generation you're going to lose weight. Simple physics.",
          "Yeah I feel that CICO takes the power out of food, even my “f it days”, because it all gets tracked regardless. If I have a high calorie day I know pretty much exactly how high calorie it is lol and I can therefore accurately predict its impact, which is comforting for me. The times I felt I overate but I didn’t know the calorie content - not even a rough estimation - were way more stressful cause of course my brain assumed the worst and then look for confirmation (eg next day weigh in is a little higher, see of course I knew I ate 1000000 calories yesterday!!! Im screwed!! vs “yep I ate 4000 calories today, scale will be up for a few days, but I didn’t gain 1 lb of fat from this”)",
          "I’m doing it now and it’s working better than anything else ever has. Intuitive eating, but I do focus on getting enough protein and fiber, and eating probiotic foods. I don’t work out except gardening and gentle yoga, I don’t count calories, I weigh once a week-ish and the pounds are dropping off. But the only reason is because I eat NO fast food. I went gluten free plant based, which requires me to cook pretty much all my meals at home. I think cutting out 98% of junk food the biggest reason for success. \n\nSo while there’s no “monitoring” on my part, I do keep a pretty ascetic diet. I believe this is the “right way,” if there is such a thing. CICO is a band-aid solution imo. Most people don’t ever pick up intuitive eating from calorie counting, and when they stop doing it religiously, they regain. I couldn’t change my relationship to food as long as I continued to obsess about it, which was what calorie counting was for me. Just another way to think about food all day. For me, all those weight-loss tips and tricks were work-arounds to try to avoid doing the one big thing—actually eating a truly clean diet. When I committed to changing my habits for good, it became easy. I stopped having cravings for junk food, I started hearing my body’s hunger and fullness signals, I was feeding my good bacteria from the toes up and everything from my weight to my skin to my hair to my energy levels have drastically improved. My chronic headaches and heartburn are gone. \n\nAn example of a day of eating for me:\n\nBreakfast- tofu scramble with salsa, fruit salad (clementines, blueberries and pomegranates), coffee with organic unsweetened soy milk\n\nLunch: Vegetarian lentil chili (large bowl) with fresh chopped peppers and onions and crushed tortilla chips\n\nDinner: Yellow curry with garbanzo beans over brown rice, rice paper spring roll (raw, not fried)\n\nDessert: homemade vegan ice cream and black bean brownie\n\nSnacks: apple with organic super chunky peanut butter, homemade fig bar, ra",

For them, trying to lose weight through Cico is impossible because they genetically are unable to control the desire to eat.   I agree that you must have less calories taken in than used daily to have lost, but when I say that method does not work for some because of mitigating factors.  We have all heard that limiting calories too much can cause the body to be more efficient in using those calories causing plateaus.  The only way out is to tell the body it does not have to do that and eat more in a sensible amount.",

People are horrible about it. For a lot of reasons. If you arent tracking EVERYTHING you eat or drink then your not trying. Use a food scale. Its honestly not hard. I track my food while I eat.

There are several “tricks” for helping that out. Wegovy is one, but so is atkins and intermittent fasting. Being upset because a person found a way that works for them is absurd. The only time you could reasonably be angry is if the person said something like “you can lose weight without any help at all, just like me, using CICO.”",
          "I also feel like calorie counting for me takes the guess work out. If I chose some new diet to take on just for the purpose of weight loss I would feel constantly unsure if it’s actually working, I’d feel more obsessive about weighing and weight fluctuations and bloating etc. Meanwhile I am so confident in CICO and in the accuracy of my counting that when the scale goes up I don’t blink at it, I KNOW it’s water, I KNOW I am still losing weight. I used to be so obsessive about food and body image as a teen when I didn’t know how anything worked but CICO really brought me down to earth and made the process very scientific rather than emotional which has been so essential to me.",

Still have another 50lbs to go but I don’t feel overwhelmed because the math of CICO is simple. \n\nI put in my calorie allowance for 1300 calories a day to account for the fact that measurements aren’t always accurate and I likely eat more than that a day in oils. Since I track as best as I can without a scale I find that the lower calorie allowance affords for any slight miscalculations and it evens out to weight loss all the same.",

And reducing carbohydrates has benefits in limiting people's blood sugar spikes which reduces cravings overall. Especially limiting processed sugars as much possible. \n\nCounting calories may seem to be the most *efficient* method on paper. And it definitely is. But in practice people don't stick to it long-term because they don't learn proper eating habits or proper portion sizes. And no one is going to count calories for the rest of their life. So using natural methods like portion control and significantly reducing the portion of a particular food group tends to yield better long-term results.\n\nIt's easier **long-term** (in terms of sustaining weight loss) to make a lifestyle change and swap that garlic bread for roasted green beans than it is to count 300 calories for 4 oreos.",

It definitely lets me shrug it off more easily. Also though, when I do get off track, knowing how much off it really is lets me relax a little instead of building it up in my head. I seldom overeat to the extent my emotional brain thinks I did, and I can override it with logic instead of getting hung up on it.",

Imagine what life would be like here if they *did* change, and we aren’t suddenly in the land of high fructose corn syrup and potato products, but actual healthy food.

It just turns it off, and it is such a relief to live like a normal person without constantly obsessing about food.  You don't need to be obese to get the drugs, just overweight, and you can get a prescription from your GP, or even with a telehealth appointment.  Or, alternatively, there are companies that sell compounded versions (like semaglutide mixed with vitamin B) that are significantly cheaper than the brand-name versions, so I don't think these drugs are necessarily as out of reach for you as you might think.  Additionally, if you use saxenda or victoza (which are daily injections and are exactly the same drug just under different names) you have the ability to control the dosage.  I lost my first 95 lbs on low-dose Saxenda without having to go anywhere near the max dosage to control the food noise.  It helped save a lot of money because if you're only taking 1/4 the dose the pen lasts four times longer.   \n\nI recall you posting recently on this thread about having BED.  There are drugs like Contrave (wellbutrin plus naltrexone) that have been shown to be remarkably effective for BED.  Again, you don't need to get them from a psych doctor.  Your regular doctor or telehealth will do.

My understanding is that earlier GLP-1s (like liraglutide) were made available at scale in France and there has been a long term slight increase in incidences of thyroid cancer from that population of GLP-1- treated diabetics. Thyroid cancer has like a 99% survival rate, they can usually just remove the gland before metastasis and you have to take thyroid hormone medication for life after that.

          "I tried many times to lose the weight. I was never successful until I got on a GLP-1. Best decision I ever made. I lost just over 100 pounds and have kept it off. I haven’t gotten any negative responses when I’ve shared my use of the meds when asked. Most people are just curious and happy for me.",
          "Bullying people for using GLP-1 agonist drugs is like bullying people for using medications to treat high cholesterol or high blood pressure; both of those conditions can usually be managed with lifestyle changes, but for some reason we aren't faulting those people for getting help from medications and using the drugs for long-term control.  \nAnd then there is the fake concern from people saying \"well... those people will probably have long-term health risks from the drug\", or \"they'll just gain all the weight back when they stop\".  In reality, the bullies couldn't give two poops about the health of others, they're just looking to make people feel bad.    \nGLP-1 agonists were a god send to me.  I was insulin resistance, and I also had not realised how much persistent food noise I had been suffering from until the medications turned it off.  I had to put a lot of work into accurately tracking my food and also cognitive behavioural therapy to get over scale-phobia issues I had, but the medications definitely helped ease that journey towards sustainable lifestyle change.  I've been on them four years and lost 100 lbs. and  I will be on them for life if at all possible, because when I have tried to taper off the food noise returns with a vengeance and I also find my blood sugar is not nearly as well managed. But the problem I have with being an \"early adopter\" of these drugs is that I have been maintaining a healthy weight for so long now that it is confuses how to classify my need for them.  The FDA approval for Wegovy and Saxenda says \"weight management\", not \"weight loss\" and I definitely use the drugs for their FDA approved purpose, but many doctors still see them as weight loss drugs, not weight management drugs.  Even though it was my endo that prescribed it, I've had push-back from my GP and her PA over me still being on them, and I was getting snarky comments every time I saw them about me \"misusing\" the drugs and they even tried to cancel the prescription once",
          "GLP-1 inhibitors. should be treated like an alternative to WLS (or as a diabetes treatment as originally intended.) those who go on it should plan to be on it for life.\n\nFor those that take it without “needing” to, such as to speed up a moderate amount of weight loss (I’m spitballing but let’s say 50lbs or less) these drugs work by crushing appetite so folks end up eating very little per day. Like under 1000 calories. It’s just easier because they feel satisfied and their blood sugar is stable.\n\nWhen that is stopped and the person gains back their appetite they will either regain or need to continue eating very little to not have their body rebound to a higher weight. Even if the person immediately switched to “maintenance” calories for their new weight they’d likely see some gain simply from having blood sugar fluctuations again.\n\nIt may be an absolute cure for obesity and lifesaving for many people, but those that use it for so-called “vanity” pounds will probably see some rebound when the fad dies down. That’s my prediction at least!\n\nETA: there’s also been issues with people getting it from medspas for moderate weight loss because they’re eating so little they’re rapidly losing muscle mass.",
          "You hear this everywhere and you are exactly right to tune it out.  Tune it out - completely.   I’m you 20 years later, after white knuckling, gaining and losing, sometimes a good few successful years mixed in.  These medicines are a gift, a scientific breakthrough, hold on and jump it.  Will you be on it for a very long time, sure probably, but who cares, obesity is a chronic disease and society allows lifelong meds for all other chronic diseases.  Stats: 1 year in on a GLP1, 60lbs down, lost 95% of excess weight, went from size 16/18 to size 4, BP and cholesterol in control now also. Best of luck, it’ll change your life.",
          "The drug works by increasing GLP-1 in the gut, which is supposed to be produced when you eat.\n\nGLP-1 production is regulated by fiber. Unfortunately, modern food processing methods remove most of the fiber from our foods, which means nearly everyone in the U.S. is getting well under the daily recommended value. Even most bread lacks adequate fiber.\n\nOur ancestors were eating 60-100 grams of fiber per day, most Americans currently eat less than 10g per day.\n\nThe tldr;\n\nUp your fiber consumption, it will have the same effect as the shots do.\n\nI use Psyllium husk, and just mix it into my food. I noticed it's also helped with my POTS, tachycardia, cardio, even my brain fog (something about the gut/brain link I guess). Just make sure you drink lots of water",

          "The documentation so far indicate it's a lifetime medication. Much like most cases of high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, etc. It's not a \"take for X months and you're cured\". That's fine, as long as you're aware of that going in. Just like any other medication, there's a chance of side effects. Again, fine as long as you know that going in. It's absolutely worth talking to your doctor about, and seeing if that's something that might help you. \n\nNo one gets all shitty on people who have tried to manage their cholesterol with diet and exercise, and still need to be on statins. It should be the same for GLP-1 medications.",
          "GLP-1s will end that for you. Is there like a rule where people on this sub aren’t supposed to talk about the nearly side effect free miracle drugs that have turned the companies that made them into half-trillion dollar enterprises over night? I lost 100 lbs without really trying. When you’re obese your metabolism and gut hormones and brain have all been rearchitected in. Away that conspires to keep you fat. Address the root cause with chemistry and the problem solves it self.",

          "(Not medical advice, just my thoughts:) \n\nFirst, I totally acknowledge that I’ve had way above average results in terms of weight lost for my med, although that gap seems to narrow with each new generation of meds. \n\nAs far as timeline, we’ve had FDA-approved GLP1s in the us since 2005, and while that doesn’t exclude the possibly of unknown unknowns, we’re also not flying totally blind here. \n\nIt’s very clear that the current generation of anti-obesity meds will, for most people, require maintenance treatment for maintaining the results, in much the same way that most people who start anti-hypertensives need them long term. An actually fairly common issue I see, unfortunately, is doctors setting patients up with expectations that they will only need it a short time, that they can likely maintain off the drug etc. It seems like setting people up for a hard fall, and it’s not evidence based.  \n\nInterestingly, there’s at least one med being studied right now (AMG133) that shows early promise in research for having more durable results after people stop the meds. It’ll be very interesting to see where that goes.  \n\nAnd I think we’re just starting to see significant amounts of people experimenting with options like stretching out doses of their current meds, lower maintenance doses, stopping and restarting only if they gain, switching to cheaper anti-obesity meds for maintenance, using meds as a bridge to bariatric surgery etc. \n\nWe know in general that losing and maintaining even a small loss can have significant health benefits. We also now have data on how semaglutide specifically can reduce the risk of death from certain causes for overweight and obese people with cardiovascular disease.  https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563 and I think it’ll definitely be interesting to see more research along these lines. \n\nYou’re right, the risk benefit conversation is potentially very different for someone 15lbs overweight versus 150lbs overweight.

          "I am on Ozempic currently and was on Wegovy for 4 months before I struggled to get it due to the shortage. As you probably know, it is essentially the same drug.\n\nI have always been hesitant about weight loss drugs, but people’s experiences with this one started peaking my interest in 2021. It took two years for me and a medical issue to approach my doctor about it. \n\nI spend a lot of time on the internet talking about GLP-1s and heart-related issues are not considered a common side effect. If anything, semaglutide has a positive effect for many with cardiovascular issues - https://www.uchealth.org/today/wegovy-study-finds-weight-loss-drug-semaglutide-cuts-heart-attacks-strokes-cardiac-deaths/\n\nThese drugs have completely changed my life for the better. I’ve lose over 50 lbs in 6 months. I am sticking to a healthy diet without the hunger or cravings that have caused me to deviate in previous attempts. I’m naturally drawn to healthy foods, but occasionally indulge in a cheeseburger or a slice of pizza. \n\nMy side effects have been minor and infrequent. The biggest one has been constipation and it has cleared up with OTC meds. I also have had some diarrhea here and there and maybe some fatigue but it’s minor. \n\nMost people gain weight when they stop taking the medication. Many doctors believe that chronically obese patients have to be on it for life to maintain their goal weight. My doctor tries to slowly titrate everyone off, but will adjust your dose back up if you start to gain. For people that can maintain without it, she has them weigh at least once a month so they can get back on the drug if you gain significant weight. \n\nThere are risks, as there are with any drug. And if you can lose and maintain a healthy weight without this, you should. This wasn’t possible for me after countless attempts and the risks are minor compared to the known outcomes of being obese for decades. \n\nMy biggest concern about being on this medication is the fact that supply always seems t",

          "It works. It reduces food noise quite a lot. However, as others have said, you need to address the issues for the obesity in the mean time.\n\nI didn't start mine until I'd lost 40 pounds on my own. I'm still religiously calorie counting even while taking it. I'm also adding exercise and walking into the equation.\n\nFor me, adding semaglutide was more to reduce food noise and the associated stress, because I have a lot of other behaviors I'm working on right now and I don't want to feel so overwhelmed. I'm losing a bit faster on it, maybe an extra pound or two per month. The big thing is just that it's assisting me and my stress levels; I'm not constantly fighting food urges.\n\nWhen I go off of it, the urges will return. But I'm working diligently on mental health, establishing healthy behaviors, and in particular establishing healthy coping mechanisms. \n\nI really think people on this drug need to be pursuing self improvement in lots of other ways OUTSIDE of the semaglutide when they're taking it. Those healthy behaviors like walking, calorie tracking, and finding healthy coping mechanisms, will ultimately be the things that allow you to keep off the weight.\n\nMake no mistake the drugs themselves are gamechangers, but only if you're *also* willing to put in the effort outside of the semaglutide. \n\nFor me, semaglutide is more about reducing the stress of losing weight, and not actually about losing the weight itself.\n\nEdit: I also think it's a gamechanger for folks who have *always* been morbidly obese. The first time I lost weight I did it naturally, and went from 370 to 265 at my lowest. It's actually *unbeleivable* how much better you feel. People tell you that, but experiencing it yourself is something else. You literally *breathe* better. My feet got warmer and sweatier. My brainfog was reduced. My mood and confidence improved. \n\nIt's tough to lose weight when you actually don't know what being smaller feels like. Once you've lost weight, you know how good it feels,",

          "So tired of shaming/judgment re GLP-1 drugs. So first off all, I'm not taking Ozempic/wegovy/etc yet, but I'm definitely GLP-curious and I have an appointment with my doctor to discuss it in the new year. My background in a nutshell, I lost a lot of weight a few years ago but between a sudden job loss, the pandemic and three pregnancies (two successful, one loss) I gained a lot of it back. Now I'm nearly back where I started but with a postpartum body, two little kids, and a very demanding job (I'm a public defender). \n\nLike a lot of people, I've been watching the news around the semaglutide class of drugs with a lot of interest. If the early results hold, seems like this is a medication that could really change a lot of lives - not just for weight loss, but other types of impulsive behavior too. That's amazing! But I t seems like everywhere I look, people are determined to shit on it. \"It's just compensating for lack of discipline\" \"as soon as you stop taking it you'll just gain the weight back\" \"there are side effects\" \"you're not really healing your relationship with food\" \"it doesn't work for everyone\" etc etc etc. \n\nGuess what? I don't care!! I have one life to live, this one. Could I \"learn better discipline\" and manage my weight on my own? Maybe. But also maybe not, or maybe yes but I'll struggle for 20 years first, or maybe yes but it will be a white knuckle struggle every day that will distract me from the things I love in life. I want to run around with my kids and watch them grow up and feel good in a bathing suit and smile when I look at pictures of myself. That *matters more to me* than \"healing my relationship with food.\" If that means I take a drug forever, I take it forever, fine! I'll also probably take my ADHD meds forever. And if it doesn't work for me or the side effects are too bad, I'm no worse off than I am right now. \n\nThe discourse around this is truly making me feel insane, I just do not get the constant moralizing and finger-wagging. On my deathbed no one is going to be like \"she lived a long and healthy life but unfortunately she never healed her relationship with food.\" People have been shitting on Oprah on social media for using it to lose weight. There's a TrueReddit thread where someone commented \"I got a gastric sleeve and my coworker is taking Ozempic and they didn't lose as much weight as me ￼so it's not even the best treatment for obesity\" are you serious?? Is the argument truly that a major abdominal surgery is somehow more pure than a pharmaceutical intervention? ￼What is our collective hang up about this? Why can't we just be happy for people who are able to benefit from it?\n\nRant over! But I'd love to hear if I'm alone on this.\n\nEDIT actually rant not over, I have a little more to say. As a fat woman it feels like my body is so...I don't know if commodified is precisely the right word but it's close. Like, half the messages I get from my liberal circles are that it's some kind of betrayal if I want to lose weight at all, while at the same time the other half of society acts like I'm a worthless person if I don't lose it, but I better lose it right and not do anything to make it easier, because that's cheating! Enough. I don't know when we as a society decided that fat people's bodies are some kind of communal property that everyone gets a say in but I'm just so so tired of it.\n\nEDIT2 A lot of people are telling me not to worry about what other people think and I guess I should clarify that this isn't so much about me feeling shamed or attacked. I just think the Discourse is truly bizarre. It's almost like society at large is rooting against fat people's lives improving. My completely baseless hypothesis is that since many people consciously or subconsciously view obesity as a moral failing, they are outraged by the idea that we could improve our lives without suffering, like we don't deserve to have good lives without doing some kind of penance first. Which, after all the hand-wringing about health/healthcare costs, is just so nakedly hypocritical that it floors me.",

His weight shot up again. He's now on semaglutide waiting to get to the higher dose again. \n\nIt's really important to work on habits while on this medication. You won't be on it forever.",

          "My friend. Stop suffering. Go to the doctor and get her to prescribe some version or semaglutide and rid yourself of this cruel, senseless suffering. There are side effects yes. Just as they're side effects associated with obesity, like negative mental health. Possibly your chemistry is off and can't be permanently fixed. But semaglutide can help..dont let ppl who dont understand how weight gain impacts the body chemistry influence you otherwise.",
          "I’m on compounded semaglutide. I’ve lost 78lbs, 103 since my highest weight. I have great energy and a way better mood. Less inflammation even before I lost a significant amount of weight. I feel like every weight loss tool is stigmatized, it’s laughable. I’ve been overweight my whole life, I deserve help and so does anyone who needs it.",
          "You will have the same hunger cues before and after the drug. But that’s the same for standard weight loss. I am still as hungry at 128 as I was at 240. I have maintained (even lost) for several weeks at a time off semaglutide. I’m back on it to lose my last 11lbs, but the experience simply makes calorie deficits easier it does not change your biology permanently except your physical weight. \n\nI lost 100lbs naturally with CICO, still needed the semaglutide to get down to my preferred weight but the hunger cues will always come back, even if I lost the last bit naturally.",
          "For what it’s worth, semaglutide has been around for >10 years on the market as a diabetes drug with the known side effect for weight loss, so it’s not exactly experimental. I’m only able to avoid binges by keeping those foods out of the house",
          "Very well written, and I couldn’t agree more. I’m 10 months and 31kg (66lbs) into my weight loss with semaglutide and I echo everything you said. I had a similar realization a few days in that what I was feeling (constantly seeking out food) isn’t “normal”. I also felt a bit of anger and sadness that I spent 20 years of my life beating myself up about how I couldn’t just lose weight the “right way”.",
          "Semaglutide is a tool & doesn’t deserve the stigma.. This is a bit of a manifesto but I want  to talk about my personal experience with taking semaglutide because I see a lot of negativity surrounding it in the media, as well as in this sub. I’d love to hear other people’s experiences with it as well - good, bad, and neutral so we can get a wider overview. I personally take the brand name Ozempic at the .25mg dose, though other injectables like Wegovy and Mounjaro, as well as the tablets like Rybelsus all fall under the umbrella of semaglutide. \n\nMy weight loss journey started young, maybe when I was twelve or thirteen, but I’ll just talk about the two most recent ones because they’re the most interesting to compare. When I was 20, I lost 70 pounds (230>160) in 2 years by following an intensive regime of CICO, meal prep, intermittent fasting, and daily exercise. Y’all were quite proud of me at the time as I did it all the “right way”!\n\nI was able to maintain for about a year until I began having severe symptoms no one could really explain. I ended up being diagnosed with osteoporosis, a sleep disorder, a nutritional deficiency, chronic fatigue syndrome, anxiety, depression, and fibromyalgia. What followed was a six year losing battle to keep weight off while throwing the majority of my energy into managing my symptoms well enough to live in the world. I gained 100 pounds, then 20 more during the pandemic.\n\nLast May, my birth mother died of complications of Type 2 Diabetes, and in an effort to get the best preventative diabetes treatment plan, I sought expert medical advice from a private practice endocrinologist. I was quickly diagnosed with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia - I had a *crazy high* amount of insulin in my system for someone who was not diabetic. Like, 20 times the amount of insulin I needed in my blood at all times to manage a regular amount of blood sugar. It had never been caught because hilariously, my blood sugar is always perfect as well as my A1C, but it would eventually cause an unmanageable combination of type I & type II diabetes by shutting down my pancreas and making my body unresponsive to insulin. We can’t be sure what caused this, but it’s likely a combination of genetic factors and prenatal exposure to uncontrolled diabetes. Either way, I started treatment immediately. \n\nI took Metformin for the first year. Lost 30 pounds with small changes to my routine and also literally cured most of my issues (except the spinal fractures lol). I plateaued in March so my endo suggested taking things to the next level with Ozempic. Metformin did a lot for me but she is right, semaglutide has stepped things up. I already felt better but now I can confidently say that I feel awake, alert, and relatively pain free for the first time since my early teens. I also don’t feel a constant, gnawing starvation pain that I must overcome - a feeling I used to think of as just “regular hunger” because it was all I knew. \n\nThe lifestyle changes I consciously followed while on Metformin have become intuitive. For instance, it is pleasant to exercise every other day when you’re muscles can efficiently convert blood sugars into useful ATPs - it doesn’t cause me pain and I recover quickly! It also also easier to do just about every single thing when you’re not constantly hurting and falling asleep. For example, I can almost always muster the energy to cook for myself. On top of it all, I am no longer contending with all of that insulin in my blood screaming desperately for more sugar 24/7. The mental quietude is astonishing and instead of fighting with my cravings, I can put that energy elsewhere. \n\nSo yeah. I haven’t lost much yet, maybe three pounds a month? But I feel normal, possibly for the first time in my entire life. I’m also probably not going to develop diabetes now, which means it won’t kill me in my 50’s, like it did to my birth mother. In general, I don’t really care what others think of me but I worry people will keep away from this medication because of the stigma. There are a legitimate number of reasons not to take it. To name a few: it is expensive, it’s a shot, it’s possibly lifelong, some of the side effects people experience are harsh… But it is not “cheating”. It is not “the easy way out”. It is not “just an appetite suppressant” or otherwise somehow symbolic of your moral failures as a fat person. It’s a medication that treats a disorder and like all medications your doctor may suggest, it is a tool. \n\nQuestions, concerns, comment? You should talk to a doctor about medical issues, and I am not a doctor! But I would be happy to clarify anything that I’ve written about my own experience above.",
          "I’ve been on and off semaglutide. It’s crazy to notice how different things are on it. When I’m not using it my body will actually wake me up at night and tell me I’m hungry even though I know I ate a snack and dinner. Today I forgot my lunch and had a very small breakfast but I’m not worried and I’m only on the beginning dose but when I’m off it I feel constantly hungry.",
          "I am surprised to hear it was even prescribed to someone with an average BMI. Of course it isn’t going to work correctly if you’re using semaglutide to support what is essentially an eating disorder. Becoming underweight due to rapid weight loss is extremely bad for your body and can permanently alter your metabolic process.",
          "I’m taking semaglutide (not one of the brand name drugs as they’re too expensive) and it totally works for me. I’ve lost close to 30lbs without trying and I’m now in a healthy BMI. I just don’t think about food nearly as much as I used to. I don’t have any negative side effects either.\n\nJust like the allergy meds I’ve had to take for the past 25 years and will have to take the rest of my life, I expect I’ll need to stay on this as well and I’m ok with that.",
          "It works and is not a placebo, there’s ample evidence of that.\n\nIf you go off the medicine you’ll likely regain at least part of the lost weight, you’ll likely have to keep taking it or another GLP-1 to maintain the weight loss.\n\nThere is not a plethora of shady pharmacies hurting people with tainted products.  I have not heard of a single instance of someone being harmed by taking compounded or reconstituted semaglutide or tirzepatide.  Considering the millions that have taken the non-branded medication that’s pretty remarkable and a testimony to its safety.",

I can still eat normally socially and enjoy carbs guilt free, and overall feels way more sustainable to me.\n\nI think there’s a good chance keto works so well for fat loss because you eat higher protein = high satiety.

If they overeat on a low carb diet they will gain.\n\nI'm not really sure what the point of your comment is.\n\nLow carb diets target blood sugar spikes and crashes, make people feel satiety, and reduce cravings.

          "The problem with low card is that it gets treated like a religion not a science. My message was that Gary Taubes is a bit of a tosser benefitting of the over weight community with cherry picked science and flagrantly wrong conclusions. I did not denounce the science community, but not unexpectedly that is the conclusion some draw as I attack their ‘leader’. I worked for over a decade in scientific publishing. One of the biggest risks is people (mostly popular press) taking isolated research and drawing sweeping conclusions (if certain effects are shown in an isolated lab result it may not reflect the same way inside the human body). That or taking something from one field and using it as a positive in another field.\n\nThere are a lot of rough estimations in Cico, metabolism is different, for example fibers get treated as 4 cal/gram in the US but 2 gram in Europe (as they mostly do not get absorbed/metabolized). Also fresh ingredients have different calories depending on soil, weather, time of year. So counting exactly what goes in is impossible, so is counting energy out. You can get to a good enough estimation though and it results in a good enough control of weight gain or loss.\n\nAre there benefits in low(er)carb diet?, sure, many, especially if it helps cut out empty calories like processed/added sugar and other junk food. It is a great way to reduce calories too so you eat less and lose weight. It does not enable you to magically eat 10000 calories and not gain weight.",
          "Low carb/Keto is awesome because not hungry at all! You only have to deal with cravings. Almost like you have to force yourself to eat.

Taubes claims that low carb diets lead to weight loss “independent of the calories we consume from dietary fat and protein” which is blatantly false.\n\nI can't respond in that thread because /u/reduxrouge blocked me. So I will respond to you here.\n\nI'm personally not interested in Taube's views. \n\nI know the impact of carbohydrates have on human metabolism, endocrine system, mental health, mood, cravings, blood sugar, and weight loss.\n\nAs far as I'm aware all of these influencers/PhDs believe in the model of energy in versus energy out (CICO). They just don't agree on the details about the CI or the details about the CO based on various genetic processes that occur. \n\nFor example your summary article says: \"The laws of physics tell us that if you ate 7000 calories of protein and fat during a period of time when you only expended 3500 calories, you would gain a pound, even if you ate no carbohydrates at all.\"\n\nWell this isn't true because if you eat 7000 calories of protein (like chicken or beef), you're only absorbing maybe 80% of those calories. Whereas for carbohydrates it's more like 99.9999% that you're absorbing. Therefor the idea that you'll gain the same amount of weight and fat distribution eating 7000 calories of chicken versus 7000 calories of carbs is false, as supported by science. Will you gain weight overall eating 7000 calories when your maintenance is 3500? Absolutely. And there isn't a single person who denies this fact. \n\nI haven't read Gary Taube's book or watched any of his stuff so I can't really comment on the snippet of text that's in the summary. Seems like it was maybe taken out of context of a larger paragraph explaining something entirely different? \n\nOne of the commenters wro",

I get told by family and friends all the time that I'm starving him but the first thing my vet always says is \"I'm so happy to see a healthy weight GSD!\" People get used to how things are and perception can be skewed. You do what's right for you!",
          "Thank you so much for sharing. This is so incredibly validating. I have a very similar journey and have had all of these realizations recently— particularly realizing that obesity is a treatable medical condition that is largely affected by physiological and genetic factors and NOT a moral or personal failing.",
          "Honestly, two years in and I still feel like shouting it off of rooftops. It hurts my heart to see how many people struggling with obesity are trapped in really destructive beliefs about themselves.",

Do they think the ones they are putting down for no willpower, refusing to get good eating habits or other thing they use for fat shaming have not tried numerous times to follow good eating and have the willpower but need help?  You would not tell someone to forgo heart meds cause all they have to do is eat better and have willpower.",

Addiction for instance is often blamed on genetics, high blood pressure, and of course obesity, but these are also all caused by and resolved by behavior. Genetic diseases and disorders of course exist but the term is also used a lot without much behind it.",

          "Eh, it's more that if you don't use the \"freebie\" time the medications give you to make permanent changes to your lifestyle, and prepare for the rebound effect afterwards, you'll gain it all back. Most people (self included, so no judgement here) don't actually make realistic long term changes, because it's so much easier to lose weight when on the medication. It's easy to say no to that piece of cake, easy not to grab an extra slice of pizza when you're not hungry. But once the medication stops, you're actually hungry again and you need to know how to manage those feelings. You need to evaluate and question \"am I actually hungry, or do I just feel that way because there's something delicious in front of me, or am I just bored?\"",

          "I’m totally with you. \n\nI love to cook and eat too - but actually I love cooking mostly to feed others. It brings me joy to see them eat food I made. \n\nThe magic pill you’re describing is semaglutide. It was everything I ever wished for. My intense hunger that I’ve always felt completely vanished. I could go whole days without eating. I have NEVER in my life felt freedom like that. \nI didn’t miss cooking, I didn’t miss eating. I didn’t care for food. \nIf I could take a pill 3 times a day and not be hungry, and get the nutrients I needed, I would.\n\nSure, I like eating and cooking. But those joys do NOT up weigh the total freedom not never worrying about calories! Never panicking about hunger and over-eating, again, because you panic-ate too big a portion because the hunger was so intense you felt like a rabid animal. \n\nI’ve dealt with intense, distracting, loud hunger all my adult life. And it’s my main motivator to eat, to get rid of it. Semaglutide removed that hunger and it was freedom. Total mental freedom. I got so much stuff done because I didn’t obsess about food and didn’t have to bow to my stupid brain demanding food again. I no longer had to waste time on planning and making food. \n\nSadly I couldn’t stay on semaglutide, partially because I enjoyed never feeling hungry, and naturally just didn’t eat. I lost a lot of muscle that way, unfortunately. \n\nSo I’m totally with you. And I can confirm that once hunger is gone, it’s complete and utter freedom. I’d pay so much money for such a pill you’re describing, where you get exactly the right amount of calories, IF you were never hungry. If the hunger is truly gone and I never have to think about food again, I’d pay all my money for such a pill.",

I am taking Berberine right now, which is suppressing my appetite but I still make sure to eat something just so I don't burn myself again.",
          "I'm on wegovy, but same diff. It's entirely transformational. \n\nI am typically driven to eat as a reaction to other stuff. Like tired, eat, hungry, eat, stressed out, eat, depressed, eat. I can be full, but if I'm stressed out I still want to eat more. As a parent of multiple children with mental health and other issues and a high stress job, there's no way to reduce the stress or even really control the food that's in the house (the other adults are not on board with having only healthy food in the house). So, I just can't stop eating. \n\nThis medication changes that for me entirely. Whatever dopamine hit I normally get from food just doesn't happen while I'm taking this stuff for some reason. When I'm moderately full I literally cannot eat more whereas when not on the medication I could literally eat another meal even when already full. \n\nThe only thing that would make me want to stop taking this is if I got the gastroparesis some people have reported or I guess if I lost my insurance, but if that's gone so is my job so, having too much food laying around might not be an issue then....",
          "I'm glad you're finding something that works for you. Sounds like you're already putting in the hard work and this medication is a tool that is giving you what you need to get through the hunger.  \n\nI will say that I am vastly less hungry after losing weight-- being over 300 pounds I found my hunger cues were all over the place. While I do get hungry now, it's nothing I can't fix with a small snack like some protein powder or a piece of fruit.  \n\nHopefully you're able to get where you need, and once you do, find that your hunger cues have normalized.",
          "Honestly? I take Wellbutrin + naltrexone -- basically poor man's contrave. It seems to hijack the endorphin high I used to get from overeating and makes me aware of how full I am. I honestly had no idea how thin people worked until I did this - now I am overfull on a single bagel. It has made so clear to me that my relationship to food was truly an addiction that kept me from actually enjoying eating. Now I eat well, enjoy the heck out of those green beans and quinoa, and am exploring all kinds of ways to treat myself with tastes and textures that actually nourish me in good healthy portions. \n\nYMMV, of course. And I'm fully under a doctor's care. I might have to do this for the rest of my life. That's ok with me. I'm getting healthier and having less pain every single day.",
          "Honestly, the way the drug works sort of mirrors my experience with going plant based/whole foods for weight loss, but without the side effects. Plant-based whole foods are really hard to overeat because they're just not as tasty as meat, dairy, and fried foods. I can sit down with a plate of veggies and scrambled tofu and know exactly when I'm full because there's nothing in the food that trips that addictive dopamine circuit in my brain that demands I eat it all because it's yummy. I like plant-based foods and even crave salads and veggies sometimes, but it's never the way it is with a cheeseburger or lasagna, where I miss my fullness signals because it's so yummy.\n\nI'm not at all looking down on people who need medical intervention or who eat meat. I eat meat/fish sometimes, too and I'm chronically ill, so I've got no beef with drugs, lol. I just thought it was an interesting parallel to how I feel when eating plant-based whole foods that haven't been engineered to be yummy. They're just... food.",

          "The difference for me was dramatic and eye-opening, when starting Wegovy. I can only liken it to an addiction; which makes so much sense, now that I can see the difference. Before, I just assumed I liked food, had poor self control, had family tendency to obesity, etc. Which is all true. I don't want to minimize that either.\n\nI just didn't realize how all encompassing it was. I assumed everyone felt this way, but that I just gave in too much or couldn't control it.\n\nWith the medication? I see it in a whole different light. I feel like this is how a normal appetite works, which I NEVER had previously. I realized that not everyone has this battle all day, every day.\n\nIt's a huge psychological as well as physical shift. There are absolutely downsides and side effects, but the realization of how much of my time, thought and energy was dedicated to food- and how much more control I have of it now- has been worth all of it. Total perspective shift, and I'm hoping it continues to help me stay on track.",
          "I’m not on Ozempic but on vyvanse and from what I’ve read it seems like they behave similarly in terms of cravings and  appetite suppressing.\n\nFor me, the meds have made it so that I simply don’t think about food as often. The allure it once held for me has almost evaporated. If I’m absorbed in a task I don’t have to stop everything just to have a meal even if I’m hungry. \n\nIt also helps me to resist foods that I have not planned for and eliminates mindless snacking because - again - the intense interest in food is not there anymore.  \n\nIt also helps me to stick to what I say I’m going to do it not do. If I say I’m having salad for dinner then - I can do that and not return to the kitchen for more food. Obviously, this is nothing like the way I’ve lived my life for decades. And yes I’ve lost weight as a result. \n\nHowever, I  aware of the fact that the meds  are a large part of what is making this happen for me BUT I started my weight loss journey before the medicine. I was working out regularly before then. I track all my meals and exercise and make healthy choices /plan snacks etc. The drugs are not making me do that - I could just as easily get Taco Bell on the way home when I am ready to eat something.\n\nIn this way, I think Ozempic and the like can be used as tools and not crutches to be relied upon. Those relying on medication alone to suppress appetite and not making any other lifestyle changes will of course gain back the weight- but it doesn’t HAVE to be that way- it is not a given that the meds are a “quick fix” - it is an aid not a cure.\n\nMy goal is to build healthy and sustainable  habits and structures around food  while I’m on the on the meds and therefore not having a daily internal battle about what to eat every day. That way, if for some reason I need to come off then I’ve got habits and “rules” that I’ve already been implementing so that I don’t have to rely on the sheer power of my own flimsy will.",
          "If you think you need appetite suppression, these meds are how to do it. It's just that you probably don't need appetite suppression.\n\nYou probably need a system to eat healthier foods more often. I find that people need confidence that you can do it, realistic focus to target the right things, and accountability/ a process for ownership.\n\nTaco Bell is not that good. You probably go there because you're hungry and you don't have any foods you like readily available, or you haven't tasted good food lol\n\nYou may be hungry and only allowing yourself to eat later in the day when you're tired, or you might be eating too cope with boredom. You want to sort that out. \n\nHow's your meal prep game?",

Based on your experiences personally and talking with others (as I’m sure you’ve done), do you feel that “Maunjaro as ideal” was “for you only”, and that others may have different experiences?  Or have you confirmed similar experiences from others?  Based on your success and in retrospect, would you have gone past Ozempic and gone straight for Mounjaro?  Was there something valuable about having used Ozempic first, perspective or other lessons?  Any recommendations about how to minimize cost for Maunjaro?  Or was this purely based on your insurance allowances, or similar?  Thanks so much.  Doctor appointment tomorrow, and they asked our group in a preemptive seminar on the topic to have done some research (I think with our insurance company about coverage) around any specific medications we had our hearts set on.

          "Just because it bothers me: Mounjaro is not Semaglutide, nor are some of the other GLP-1 medications out there. Some are Liraglutide, and Mounjaro is Tirzepatide. I take Mounjaro. \n\nLike you, I’ve lost this weight before. I lost 20% of my bodyweight as a teenager by constantly being too sleepy in the mornings to make it to the school breakfast (uh, I mean intermittent fasting), and by being too cheap to pay for decent meals at work. As soon as I had a boyfriend paying for my meals, I gained back all the weight plus 20lbs in one year. I’ve lost significant weight numerous times. \n\nIn 2017, I decided enough was enough. I used diet and exercise to lose 100lbs. I was also spending a good portion of every day working out. Like you, I thought a gnawing ache was normal hunger. I thought I deserved the fairly extreme discomfort for allowing myself to get so heavy. I was able to eat less because while lifting heavy, I had to be fasting or I’d throw up. I would over-exercise and never take a real rest day because 1) It was hard to eat while working out, so it was nice to be too busy to eat and, 2) I was so damned hungry ALL THE TIME that I’d burn 1,000 calories or more a day just so I could eat a satisfactory amount of food. I was in the healthy BMI range. \n\nThen, I started working. This cut drastically into my exercise schedule. Sure, I was still too busy to eat much in the mornings, but I wasn’t burning enough to just eat when I was hungry and just stop when I was satisfied. I gained weight hand over fist when I started eating according to hunger cues even though I was eating the exact same foods I ate while losing. I thought after 100 lbs, I’d earned the privilege of not feeling achingly hungry after eating, and could trust my own hunger/satiety signals. I could not. \n\nI have never actually been able to. In fact, even with Mounjaro, I’m now close enough to a healthy BMI (less than 10lbs away), that I’m actually having to limit my intake beyond what feels natural in order t",

There are risks, although they are pretty safe as drugs go, and the risks and quality of life decrease associated with obesity far outstrip them.\n\nMy first shot of Mounjaro was the single greatest quality of life increase I’ve ever felt, and it happened in a matter of hours.",
          "Thanks for this. I was on Mounjaro until the savings card ran out. Now I can’t afford it since my insurance will not cover anything; Mounjaro, Ozempic, or Wegovy. Metformin seems to be a covered medication so I’m going to try that next. I lost 30 pounds on Mounjaro and gained back 10 because the food cravings are insane.",
          "I’ve had WLS and am now on Mounjaro and using Mounjaro is the most effective I’ve ever been. Don’t be afraid to ask for medication, it can make things SO much easier.",
          "Tried *everything?*   I bet you haven't tried Mounjaro/zepbound or ozempic/wegovy\n\nget the medicine in you and get your hormones right. The healthy habits will come with time. Don't try to exercise with a 100 lb weight vest on. You will only destroy your joints. I went from class three obese to the dead center normal in one year exactly.",
          "Oooh man I had bed real bad. I never stopped with the food noise. I’d cry when I’d tell the doctors because I felt so embarrassed I’d lose weight but then just couldn’t keep it off. \n\nMounjaro has saved my life. Seriously. As a diabetic, I’m so grateful I have it. It worked miracles for me, I’ve been on the lowest dose for about 4 months now and haven’t needed to move up and lost 40 lbs or so. I’m perfectly healthy now also which is incredible. I’m so so so lucky this drug was MADE for me.",
          "I stopped mounjaro after about a year and lost 40lbs. I gained about 10 lbs after 3 months of being off of it. 5 of the 10lbs is muscle because i started working out more recently and eating a little more, initially it was hard to control the weight gain because the appetite came back full force, but now it’s manageable and I’ve been maintaining my weight for the past few weeks. Will try to slowly lose 5lbs while maintaining muscle mass. \nHave been doing dexa scans monthly to monitor.",
          "R/Mounjaro will give you even more support. Lots of people have lost over 100lbs with starting weights greater than yours. You are not alone and the medicine will help greatly curb those cravings that aren't your fault.",
          "I’m about to find out bc I’m being abrubtly taken off Mounjaro for medical reasons. I’ve used my time on the medication to work on gold habits, but I’m frankly scared that I’ll be lost without the meds. I’ll definitley update as I go through the process.",
          "I’ve lost 70 lbs on mounjaro and my insurance now will not cover it. What is your plan ? Stay on it forever ? \n\nI am stressing on what to do because I’m still not at a “healthy” weight but I also can’t afford the retail price of the medication.  I’m wondering if I can maintain on metformin or something simular.",
          "You’ve sound like you’ve got some gut and hormone things you may want to look into. What are you eating when you do eat? Are you properly nourished? Do you need to check for hormone levels? Work with a professional and a doctor. Sure ozempic helps, but it helps if you’re doing the right healthy things for your body too. I got my diet and exercise right before I started mounjaro, and I had no issues or side effects, if your tummy hurts now you may want to be careful with other things. \n\nWell wishes. Go to a doctor. Stay consistent. You got this.",
          "I didn’t take Ozempic, but I did take Mounjaro for just over a year. I lost 77 lbs, and it felt easy to me. It felt like I finally had a shot at real weight loss. \n\nI’ve tried WeightWatchers and calorie counting before but they both led to me constantly thinking about food or points or calories, every moment I wasn’t focused on something else. When I was on Mounjaro I felt like I could just be a normal person. I’d eat something and stop when I felt full. I didn’t have my mind always wanting a snack or treat or something else. \n\nUnfortunately my insurance stopped covering it and I’m going through an appeal. I haven’t had any medication in over five weeks. I am trying very hard to maintain the progress I made. I am half heartedly doing calorie counting again. So far I’ve gained 1.8 lbs back. (Christmas cookies ?) I don’t know if the medication is still in my body or not, but I am hopeful  I can continue to maintain.",
          "I didn’t realize how broken I was….until I wasn’t.  Started on Mounjaro just over a year ago at 274lbs and recently, for the first time since 2008, saw a 1 as the first number on the scale instead of a 2.  I still can’t get over it - I just stop eating when I’m full.  I STOP EATING.  I can eat two cookies & put the box away.  Eat two more 3 days later.  I have a box of Oreos at home I haven’t touched in a week. \n\nI’ve had no real side effects - I’m not losing my hair, throwing up all the time, or looking like my face caved in.  I don’t starve myself.  I just don’t want more food than I need & holy shit this is amazing!!!",
          "Lol here I am calorie counting AND on Mounjaro (Ozempic cousin) and still managing to be happy when I lose 1lb.",
          "Mounjaro 💯. Lost 70 lbs since September on it so far.",
          "I lost 60lbs with Mounjaro and I did that almost entirely without counting calories or macros. The main reason was that it reduced all the food noise in my head. If I was bored or feeling anxious my brain didn’t immediately go to food. The medication does curb appetite, but it was mainly cutting out the mindless eating that really changed things for me.",

Because it slows the emptying of your stomach, you’re basically punished with discomfort for overeating. I also found that my mood was slightly elevated and my unmedicated ADHD caused me fewer issues. I lost a hair over 40lbs total and have gained back less than 10. I took it for 7 weeks and suffered from the inability to eat/puking up whatever I forced down for another handful of weeks after my last dose. \n\nIt’s terrifying, to be frank. I wish it worked nicely for me like it seems to for others because it really helped me for a minute there before it tried to kill me.",

I ended up having to stop taking it because of the reaction and gained the weight back. I guess that's common when it is stopped. Doing traditional CICO now. It may be a magic bullet for some but in the end all it gave me was debilitating pain that caused me to faint and fall off the toilet.",

      "Sharing my real experience with Ozempic I caught the post yesterday about 'people lying about Ozempic' and was too late to the party to share my experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I worked with my doctor last summer and was prescribed Ozempic for weight loss.  At the time, I was 38 yrs old, 6' 2\", and 365lbs and am Male.  At the time, I had just done my annual checkup and all of my blood work was normal - no high A1C, no high cholesterol, sodium, etc etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a bit of back story to this - In the past, I pretty much would just eat until the food in front of me was gone.  That's what I was taught growing up - eat until your plate is clean.  It's a habit I've struggled with and have yet to overcome.  I don't really know the difference between \"hungry\" and \"not full.\"  For me it's basically \"I'm hungry\" and then \"holy shit I'm so fucking stuffed I could pop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So last summer, my doc started me on Ozempic at 0.25mg weekly dosage.  I was at this dose for about 3 months and then increased to 0.5mg weekly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first two months, the change was absolutely un-freaking-believable.  I would sit down to a meal, eat some and actually FEEL FULL.  I was able to easily stop eating with portions of food on my plate and feel completely satisfied.  In those first two months I dropped 15lbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In month three, I was still actually feeling full at meals, snacking between meals less, but the weight wasn't really dropping any longer.  This is why the doc increased me to 0.5mg.\n",
      "\n",
      "After starting the 0.5mg/week dose, this is where it all went downhill, fast.  The side effects came on hard, fast and strong.  If I ate more than say half a sandwich at a meal, I would become so overwhelmingly bloated that I was burping constantly (like literally two big burps every 3 minutes for hours).  On top of that, at this point it made my burps smell and taste so ungodly disgusting (think straight sulfur plus an outhouse at a nascar race in summer at the end of race weekend).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there were three times in a two week period that I became so bloated that it made me vomit - a lot; and I'm not exaggerating that it was complete projectile vomiting, out of my mouth and nose.  It was an absolutely ungodly horrible experience.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As if those side effects weren't bad enough, it also gave me horrible, uncontrollable diarrhea that met the clinical definition of \"severe\".  There were a few days where I couldn't leave the toilet for more than 10-15 minutes at a time.  There was one night I fell asleep on the toilet, because I was so tired from getting up to RUN to the toilet to poo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways - I stopped taking Ozempic after that experience.  However working with my doc's input, I did stop taking it for just over a month (until my system was back to normal) and then tried the 0.25mg dosage again to see if I still had all of the side effects or not - I did.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "So the reason to share this is I wanted to put out there my real world experience.  I'm hopefully in the minority of users that get the horrible side effects, and hopefully your experiences will be better than mine.  The key takeaways for me is that I need to learn the difference between \"full\" and \"not hungry\" and stop treating them as the same feeling.  It also taught me that Yes I indeed can actually make it by without snacking, and without eating a bunch of food at every meal.  Hopefully at some point I'll build up better self control and be able to manage that without medication.\n",

      "This is incorrect. Ozempic lowers blood sugar levels by mimicking the effects of GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion from the liver. If you understand science, one reason why someone might gain weight is because their body is insulin resistant (PCOS, Diabetes), their body does not recognize when insulin is released and thus does not take up glucose from their blood, causing their blood glucose to spike. A blood glucose spike causes weight gain because it tells your body to start storing glucose as fat. This process has literally nothing to do with calories, but it explains why many people still gain weight even when they are eating low calorie meals that contain glucose. Thus, the two options for this type of person is to drastically decrease their glucose intake OR to regulate it using Ozempic (or Metformin). Thus, people might be losing weight on Ozempic because it's having their body properly manage the insulin/glucose relationship and they stop storing glucose as fat while you are in a caloric deficit.\n",
