Thank you for the info. I was always curious about this so I am appreciative of the honest answer.

Gained almost <number> pounds practically overnight from paxil. It’s been like <number> years, over a year since I’ve been off it and still struggling with severe body dysmorphia now.

Weight and suicidal thoughts.. I've managed to lose <number> kg in <number> months. I was on mounjaro but it made me extremely nauseous and sick, I vomited a few times a day. So I stopped after two months. Currently my weight has been fluctuating and haven't lost even <number> in <number> days even though I eat no more than <number> calories a day and intermittently fast. This triggers me so bad I keep researching suicide methods. I don't have an eating disorder and genuinely enjoy food but the antipsychotics I take mess up with my me
