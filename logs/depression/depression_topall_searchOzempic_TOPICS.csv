I was also advised by my psychiatrist and my OB/GYN that it was safe to take during the whole duration of my pregnancy. Before warned though, one of the side effects is nausea and taking it when I was pregnant did cause me to have a very bad morning sickness. Other than that though, I would highly recommend talking to your doctor about this medicine!', 'How about escitalopram? Also a SSRI, but apparently effective and ”mild” regarding side effects and is safe during pregnancy. I’m on a combination of escitalopram and Wellbutrin (bupropion) — an NDRI (affects noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake) for depression and anxiety. I’m very sensitive to SSRIs for some reason, and escitalopram is the only one I’ve tried that didn’t cause weird side effects like depersonalization, haha. The latter is pretty odd for an antidepressant, since it kinda acts like a stimul', 'Feeling safe in car/ weird safe places. Does anyone else feel safe in their car? I\'m having a depressive episode and it\'s the worst it\'s been in almost a decade. it feels like a combo of anxiety built up and like I\'m grieving. I\'m also having ""thoughts"" but I think I\'ll be ok. I just have a lot going on and I just started ozempic while also getting off antidepressants (recommend by doctor Coz I had been doing well and had been on them for <number> years but now I prob have to go back on) anyway, I\'m sitting in m']"

I was always curious about this so I am appreciative of the honest answer. It seems like saying “this med makes me gain weight” is either the efficient way of a self aware person saying “I eat more bc of this med” or a cop out of one lacking self awareness and just blaming med, rather than the med doing anything biologically to directly cause weight gain, so I was just curious and it seems like it is an indirect cause of the med. I recommended CICO and IF since those practices c', 'Gained almost <number> pounds practically overnight from paxil. It’s been like <number> years, over a year since I’ve been off it and still struggling with severe body dysmorphia now. I won’t try meds that have weight gain as a side effect now because of course doctors are pissy about my weight but I had no control. I won’t gain more because of meds.', ""I gained a lot too after zoloft, with virtually no change in eating habits. After a number of yoyo diets and fasts, I did a sleeve gastrectomy which, with the zoloft, has enabled me to get to my pre-zoloft weight and maintain that <number> years out. Wish I could tell you things will get better weight wise, but they won't for as long as you take zoloft. It fucks with your metabolism in a way that makes you gain weight and about the only way to control the weight afterwards is to drastically curb your caloric inta""]"

It was the slippery slope for me. I gained weight up to <number> in <number> when I had a lap band placed. I'm <number> now and still losing but man! I wish I'd been more careful those <number> years. It's much more important to stay sane rather than stay slim. But it's hard either way.

Im really overweight and i want to be skinny but i cant manage to eat healthier. I want to dress more feminine, try painting my nails, trying make up. But I look too ugly for that.
