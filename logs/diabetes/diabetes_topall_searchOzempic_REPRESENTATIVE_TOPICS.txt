Ozempic is an insulin pusher. See explanation below: High insulin during a lifetime is one of the biggest causes of insulin resistance. Continuing to shoot insulin makes type <number> a progressive disease. Using an insulin pusher (a drug that makes the pancreas produce more insulin) does the same thing. Just stop eating carbohydrates and watch your BG fall. I can say this from experience. I was diagnosed <number> years ago and took the advice of physicians with whom I worked. They all told be the same thing, "Stop eat

Any T1/ <number> pump users on Ozempic using extended bolus due to slower digestion?. My wife is T1 diabetic and uses a Tandem Mobi insulin pump. She recently started Ozempic primarily to curb appetite and assist in insulin management. Her C-peptide is <number> , meaning she has almost no natural insulin production for Ozempic to boost. She's noticed her digestion has slowed significantly, which is negatively affecting her blood sugar numbers when using a standard bolus. She's curious if other Type <number> diabetics on Oz

Ozempic has been amazing (x-post from /r T1D). I just wanted to drop in and say that if anyone can get Ozempic (or any other GLP- <number> ) and is on the fence about it, go for it!

I was having a hard time getting it and Trulicity before I gave up because of the shortage. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been fda approved for weight loss. I think diabetics should have the upper hand at it. Maybe just me but I feel like it could be something that saves a diabetics life if other things aren‚Äôt working in terms of treatment for them. There are other things people can do to loose weight what if this is the only option for a diabetic? Also a lot of the times it‚Äôs like that. People try to tell you things

It's those people using it to lose 20lbs that are the biggest issue... People who are literally obese, facing health issues that are weight related, and need to lose a lot of weight... I don't blame them for jumping on it. Many are trying to avoid serious health issues, many are pre-diabetic as well. The ones using it for vanity and not for their health... they are the issue right now. And the doctors prescribing it to them.

I think people who need it to lose weight should have access to it, because it‚Äôs effective. But what needs to happen is the additional work that helps people change their relationship with food, which is almost never discussed. Because people who lose their weight will go off it and then likely regain their weight. I think your friend is incorrect about lecturing you on what to eat. But this is entirely separate from the issue of what people should have access to assist in weight loss.

>Do you have to go to the doctors to get the weekly shot? You can do the shot at home, yourself. It comes with a little tray of pen needles and you use one pen needle with the pen each week. I think it comes with eight pen needles and there are either six or eight doses per pen. For Ozempic, you do a "ramping up" dose for the first few weeks or so, to get your body used to it and see how much you need, and to make sure you tolerate it. I'm pretty sure that with at least my *first* box and with insurance

Ozempic pen usage question.

I think my co-pay per dose will be much cheaper for me if I get the 2mg dose pen and am able to dose

I am on ozempic, have been for more than <number> week... I think <number> weeks? <number> weeks? Side effects are almost nonexistent. I get the occasional wave of nausea, but it's not bad and goes away within seconds or at most minutes. I have lost <number> lbs and I am not even on the therapeutic dose yet (1mg weekly) The reason you are started on a low dose is to minimize the side effects. Go slow, and you'll get there. Even if it sucks, the side effects do go away with time. Try to stick it out.

Ozempic side effects- months later. Has anyone stopped ozempic due to vomiting and excess weight loss, and have the vomiting that last for hours come back any time nausea hits?

The impact on my blood sugar levels was also already noticeable, my average and post-meal levels started trending down. At <number> .5mg the side effects started to affect me more - just mainly nausea (that I can notice). I have short bouts of nausea in the morning and I can't e

Couldn‚Äôt be happier with the results but I‚Äôve been off of it for a week because apparently Walgreens is out of stock of 5mg, <number> .5mg and 10mg doses across my entire state.

I‚Äôve been on Mounjaro since June. My side effects have been extremely mild: when I‚Äôm on a new dose, I feel some nausea on day <number> and <number> after the injection for a few weeks.

Enough weight loss to go from <number> to <number> BMI. Liver function improved to normal. Cholesterol levels are normal. Blood pressure is totally normal, and I was able to discontinue

FYI You can‚Äôt microdose Mounjaro. The syringes come in preset doses. Typically a person will be started at the lowest dose, . <number> , to ensure that there are no adverse effects. After <number> - <number> days, dosage may be increased, depending on tolerance to the low dose and effectiveness. I started at . <number> and was bumped up to . <number> after <number> weeks.

Take it slow, realize that side effects are common, but they will fade with time. That is the reason you gradually build your dose up to 2mg. For me, it was little bouts of dizziness, which happens for a couple of seconds a few times the next day. Slight muscle cramping at injection area, not painful, just noticeable. The biggest one I've dealt with is the slowing of my gastro tract. It takes much longer for food to digest, then I get the brown runs. I have countered this with increasing my soluble AND in

I can't tell what day I take it, much less what time of day. Semaglutide is sloooow. The onset of full effect of semaglutide takes weeks, not hours. After injection, it latches onto the albumin in your blood and then the dosage trickles out from there. If you're taking <number> mg/wk, the semaglutide measured in your blood reaches a "steady state" around <number> - <number> weeks and remains pretty stable as long as you take <number> mg every week. So whether you take it morning or evening doesn't affect the distribution and pharma

Stop listening to people who "knew people". People with personal experience are sharing their personal experience. It might not be your experience.

I was waiting for it to happen because it's the most frequent side effect. It's supposed to be temporary. My diagnosis was changed to T1 so I stopped the metformin maybe a day after I hit max dose.
