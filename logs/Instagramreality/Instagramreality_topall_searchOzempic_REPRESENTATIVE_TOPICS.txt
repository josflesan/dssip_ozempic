Okay, really? I was just making a joke, and I thought it would be funny. Now you're stalking my profile and making corrections in a bunch of my comments from various subs from days and weeks and months ago? Stop. For the record I agreed with your initial criticism anyway, now I just think you're a jerk.

It does recently tho, she‚Äôs lost a lot of weight.
--- Document 2 ---
Lol yes, but you lose weight because you burn more calories than you consume. Nobody burns <number> calories naturally (unless they‚Äôre 600lbs), which is why I made the point that they would have to also work out to burn an extreme amount of extra calories to lose as much weight as claimed in the amount of time claimed in the video.
--- Document 3 ---
<number> calories is the go-to "average" amount for women to eat, it was an example. Don‚Äôt take things so literally. I‚Äôm also saying it‚Äôs literally and biologically IMPOSSIBLE to lose that amount of weight- even if she‚Äôs eating nothing at all. The average woman burns around <number> - <number> calories per day, and one pound of fat is <number> calories. The math doesn‚Äôt add up. Hence why I mentioned exercise having to be added on top of it all. Idk what you‚Äôre trying to achieve here. Also, if you‚Äôre confused: the post is ta

Did you just explain that there‚Äôs a difference in how people look between <number> and <number> because of aging?
--- Document 2 ---
I found out last night she‚Äôs <number> years younger than me and I just‚Ä¶I was in shock. I unfortunately live somewhat near her and she went into my friend‚Äôs work a couple days ago. I was told she has absolutely zero personality off camera and looked even worse in person.
--- Document 3 ---
IMO, that is not mostly age, that‚Äôs mostly surgery and/or fillers. She looks like a lot of actresses that do that. They all start to resemble one another, but that isn‚Äôt aging at all. It‚Äôs trying not to age.

there is a ton of corseting happening in that beaded dress. i can say that with <percent> certainty. i‚Äôve seen these pictures in like <number> of my pop culture groups and i‚Äôve looked pretty intently. the shape (which obviously can be manipulated) is a standard corset shape. it‚Äôs not the waist-nipping itself, but the balance in the top and bottom and the shape of the actual curve. there are slight wrinkles where the bottom of a corset would hit, and there‚Äôs a matching bump on the zipper side that could be the edge of a

Corset and hip pads!
--- Document 3 ---
It's not a corset. Corsets are bulky and the volume of the body doesn't just disappear in a void. What ever is being squished from the middle has to go somewhere - usually you get this big bump under the corset and back squish. I used to make custom made corsets and there are no black holes involved that would just make your body volume disappear. Also the lacing would be visible from the back. It would be this big bump of knots and bows in the middle. And just to get a corset sturdy enough to be laced t

Filler, not filter. A lot of young people have been using hyaluronic fillers under the impression that they will dissolve. Research has recently found out that not only do they not dissolve even <number> years later, but they also attract water and will spread out across your face. Hence the ‚Äúpillow faces‚Äù

Too many nose jobs, lip filler and probably a lip lift

r/botchedsurgery calls it 'stank face'. Cheek filler + lip filler + nose job

--- Document 1 ---
I feel like she‚Äôs being picked apart for possibly two reasons; she lost weight and she‚Äôs Indian and she hasn‚Äôt always been considered a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù celebrity, so she is subject to way more scrutiny. People get upset when certain types of women have a glow-up.
--- Document 2 ---
This woman has been raised amongst the most shallow people/environment on the planet, i.e., Hollywood. I'm not surprised she will think she needs to present a different reality to the world, especially as she was bullied for her looks ever since daddy made her a star on that TV show.
--- Document 3 ---
No we can‚Äôt. But not having women like this one polluting the world with toxic and false beauty standards might mean some of us hate ourselves a bit less. It is very sad and I do feel for her, but I feel more for her impressionable fans who see her as a role model

Tbh it‚Äôs probably just OP improperly titling it as the left arm from the viewers‚Äô perspective, and not her left. I doubt it was as deep as them thinking that the natural arm looked too big
--- Document 2 ---
I was thinking the same thing. Like, clearly the right arm is photoshopped and the left is natural‚Ä¶. Or have people gotten so immune to photoshopped bodies that they think a natural arm is somehow an error or mishap lol
--- Document 3 ---
Not sure if OP meant the arm on the left (ie her right arm) which is ridiculously short/Photoshopped, or the actual left arm which does have an odd-looking shadow

I agree from makeup, editing, and surgery her face always looks super different in every picture. Especially throughout the years. Who knows what she truly looks like without the cameras.
--- Document 2 ---
Holy crap some women are all starting to look exactly the same. I truly cannot tell if this is a member of a famous reality TV family or just some random Z-list TikToker who asked for the same procedures as the famous reality star. I keep staring at the photo, wondering, IS IT HER? You‚Äôd think celebs would realize that their face is their brand‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt they want a differentiated one?
--- Document 3 ---
Her eyebrows aren‚Äôt even the same between the photos‚Ä¶ ffs these people think we don‚Äôt have eyeballs I swear. Photoshop image clearly has a distinct arched brow while her unedited images show her real eyebrow are not like that at all‚Ä¶. And her eyes are completely different from one image to the other. Plus the complete lack of nasolabial folds which are very prominent on her real unedited face.
