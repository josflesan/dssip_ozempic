I'm very sensitive to gluten and dairy (will be bed bound and red raw if I eat them). And the cost for alternatives sky rockets with your fad dieting and misinformation. A lot of restaurant's gf options are now mor"", 'Except the fad diet is in large part responsible for the explosion of gluten free options in stores. I would have never believed we would have the amount of brands and item choices possible that there are today. Regular Restaurants will always be (and have always been) a gamble but there are actual dedicated gluten free places by me now. Multiple ones. Fad people make it profitable.', 'In my experience working in grocery stores and restaurants, people just make up food allergies and the fact that we have all these ""functional medicine doctors"" who are using peoples ignorance against them to sell books and diet plans. making people think that gluten is a artificial food additive just makes it worse.
