sick of ed’s being normalised . I came across a post today, a girl on tiktok, and she was talking about how “skinny is life, skinny is wealth, skinny is class” is nobody hearing themselves? i feel like the world has gone insane. she was saying that “fat people look trashy in designer” and so much damaging stuff and it’s so fucking annoying because it’s that mindset becoming popular that stops people recovering im so sick of it. celebrities are getting thinner, everyone’s talking about ozempic, the “big bac

This is so incredibly shallow but I do it because I want people to envy me. when I see models n other people extremely skinny I get so jealous sometimes I can’t breathe (really). And I want people to look at me and feel the same. I feel like I have nothing in my life that anybody would wanna be jealous of, except for maybe my body if I put in the work. I also just want people to like me.

do some people just not look good skinny? . i’m having an existential crisis as of late bc i’m realizing that, instead of how i always pictured i’d look skinny (for me), i actually look like a fucking starved polar bear. like i hate how i look thinner, its so unnatural, but i under no circumstances want to stop losing/ gain weight (i am normal bmi right now). in your opinion, do some people just not look good skinny? is there any way i can counteract this?? for reference i am a rather large-ish person just

Same. It seemed like the golden ticket... I wanted it so bad. Even got in a position where I could have been prescribed it. My sister went on it and lost soooooo much weight in like <number> months - the amount it would take me <number> years to lose. I had to deep dive research on the side effects and long-term effectiveness to talk myself out of it. So glad I did. Working really hard on healing my relationship with food... and feel like that has far more long-term effectiveness. My sister went off it and returned immed

While I understand why you have that point of view, the research supporting using it for weight loss is pretty solid, and there is nothing wrong with people choosing to use drugs for weight loss. Just like it's unreasonable to penalize people for being overweight, we shouldn't prevent people from using tools that could legitimately make their lives better. People who meet the clinical criteria should have access to the drugs; that doesn't mean people like OP or celebrities are trying to lose a few pounds, b

I don’t want to try it because: A) I don’t have a diabetic condition and don’t want to take away needed medication that is meant for them. (Many people who need the drug are now having a hard time getting it because other people are buying it in mass for weight loss.) B) It’s expensive. C) It’s somewhat of a newer drug and we don’t have information about long term use and potential side effects. D) I have also heard of people taking it and then when they stopped using it they ended up gaining double

grenade protein bars, a million different protein flavors, monk fruit sweetener, low cal sparkling tea, a scale that works, one of those experimental multivitamins with a bunch of thing that might contribute to weight loss, vyvanse because it’s approved for binge eating (yes it’s not sold on amazon ik), konkac jelly, a working treadmill/general exercise equipment i can keep at home, a personal trainer who will magically appear at my house and tell me exactly what workout to do, electrolyte powder, tazo tea

Walking pad.

A walking pad treadmill, fitness watch, ankle weights, pilates mat, insane amount of Grenade bars and shakes, many different flavours of protein powder, loads of instant noodles to OMAD, appetite suppressants, apple cider vinegar (idk if I believe it helps weight loss but I wanna try it), lifetime supply of Aldi protein yogurts, various fun teabag flavours and <number> sugar syrups, and tasty broths to drink, white Monster, konjac noodles, cauliflower rice...

Off topic, but how is college <money> ? Can you break down the amount per degree and w/ or w/o dorm? My bachelor’s was about <money> w/ financial aid to out of state big name school. I had my own apt after the 1st yr which was significantly cheaper than dorms. The masters was gonna cost <money> but I got sick and also could not afford that. The masters at the time was the top degree in my field at the time. And is the <money> before/after interest? I honestly don’t know how you guys afford that. My bachelor’s at

depends on if it had side effects, but if it were actually a "magical" cure with no risk, i'd pay extreme amounts of money. like i'm talking five figures, maybe six, and i'm not rich by any means, i'd seriously take out loans. i think it would be a significant return on investment bc i'm already paying like 400k for my college tuition, and my ed is significantly harming my academic and professional development. like it's the main factor standing in my way, and if i could live up to my full potential i could

I would sell my soul for Ozempic (rant). Yes, I know there are obviously people who need it much more than me and I could never afford it, anyway. But holy shit, I would genuinely be willing to have a finger removed if I could get it. I cannot stop binge eating no matter what. I've tried everything (yes, everything) and I just cannot stop eating. I used to purge, but now that my teeth are fucked I can't do that anymore. I'm gaining weight faster than I ever have in my whole life and often (like right now)

My best friend started a weightloss drug and it's triggering me so bad.. My best friend has always struggled with her weight. She has a double whammy of hypothyroidism and PCOS. Because of that is was really difficult for her to lose any weight. Her family is French and are extremely harsh to her about her weight and she has internalized a lot of it. I never thought she needed to lose weight. I always thought she looked beautiful and healthy. Back in March she started the weightloss drug Wegovy. Essential

Am I wrong for being annoyed at my ozempic mom and her food talk?. My ozempic mom is driving me crazy with her food talk. It's nonstop -- yesterday it's her declining a cookie before we ski because "I don't think I can handle all that pure sugar and fat before we ski" (while my sister and I were already eating one). A normal portion at a restaurant = "wow this is just so much food." Today I was baking a cake and it was just incessant. It looked like a mini version of one we had on a picnic years ago which

I didn’t even think of that, but I could see how having friends like this would make you want to never go out with them. I mean if she legit doesn’t want it, just eat what you want and take the rest home for the next day. I love making restaurant food last for several meals, especially in this economy :p. Bonus points if you just do it like it’s nothing - like unlike her you have years of practicing not eating enormous portions and would never order food without a « plan », because you know better.

Ed or just borderline. I feel like an imposter in most things, and I'm trying to decide if I want to talk to my doctor or he'll just see me as a hypochondriac. I don't need/want an ED label, but I kinda want to know where I am on the spectrum and see how much is "dude, just try harder, that is all pretty standard stuff" vs "you could use some external help". I know rules say no serious med advice. I'm not using this thread to diagnose. I know many people have it far more complicated and difficult. I'm ju

Thanks for posting this. I’m one of those people that does feel like a loser seeing everyone just melt their fat off of them. My primary ED has always been MIA but I’ve stopped for a long time but have HUGE body image issues. I’ve been having the hardest time losing my recommended weight of 25lb to be put in the “normal” range. I’m even doing cal counting and everything for the past month but seeing everyone get on those medications make me so tempted but what’s keeping me away is the potential side ef

i’m not an ed influencer but i do other internet things and often push through my lack of mental energy to make stuff anyway that stuff starts to affect them but if you, for example, have adhd like me, you can sort of “mute” needs. like needing to pee but putting it off so long that it goes away. i’ve had no energy cuz of my ed for years but when my depression isn’t keeping me chained to the sofa, even if my lack of energy wants to, i just ignore it. obviously this has consequences. it’s kinda like if y

You never got an answer on this. First of all if you have a diagnosed eating disorder, they won’t give it to you. It’s been linked to making these worse, because it basically causes one. It’s like an eating disorder without all the crap of being hungry. Secondly, if you went on it it’s going to ultimately make it worse. Yes you will be full, all the time, and not be able to eat, which might remove the mental aspect of food and eating, but unless you are on it forever it’s just going to get worse once yo

The guilt of eating ANYTHING is exhausting me !!!!!!!. Completely normal meal? Guilt! Tiny meal of xxx calories? Guilt! OMAD? Guilt! Skip breakfast and then have lunch? Guilt! Have a snack? You guessed it, guilt! Doing just fine, & then someone brings up weight loss/ozempic/calories/etc.... guilt over everything I've eaten today. God forbid I actually overeat! The guilt is all-consuming. So fucking tired of feeling extremely guilty like I'm a murderer or something over.... eating like a normal person
--- Document 3 ---
I understand getting used to the feeling of hunger, because hunger is usually temporary and goes away after a while even if you don't eat, plus if you ignore your hunger cues repeatedly, your body will give you less and less. BUT what about the low energy feeling? That's what I struggled with when restricting, because the lack of energy never went away and actually got worse and worse over time. So it's actually a good question OP, how are people exercising, dealing with active jobs, etc. Aside from lyi

I'm relapsing because my life feels very out of control right now (job especially) and I can't control what others do, just what I put in my mouth. When I restrict (well, eat at my set calories a day which is under what it should be) I feel in control, I feel strong, I feel worthy of something. I feel like I'm doing something right even if nothing else is going right.
--- Document 2 ---
similar control reasoning except its because if i am not restricting, i am actively suffering in every other part of my life. i cant function. but for some reason in this middle spot of restriction before shit hits the fan, i am for once in my life the kind of person who has it together. like i can really get stuff done. i have cptsd and i think its related to that as well. like focusing on this helps me unfocus on my trauma, and im able to function. if mental health care for people on medicaid was better

I believe there is an paid ad-free version of Reddit. Personally, Ozempic and other weight loss ads don’t bother me one bit. I can’t control the world around me and I certainly can’t force the world to mold to fit my personal triggers. I can’t force only control what I do. If you are so triggered, I’d recommend to stay off social media and the internet all together. Also, remember that ads are personally tailored to you. If you’re getting a lot of Ozempic and weight loss ads it’s because that’s what YOU are

do you guys keep getting erectile dysfunction pill ads?. i keep getting blue chew ads on reddit. idk why. i'm not an avid porn watcher. i don't have a penis. but i keeps getting ads from them and the only possible reason i can think of for getting them is bc erectile dysfunction shortened is ED and i'm on this sub all the time. does the algorithm think i'm having erectile dysfunction? i'm not. idk it's better than ozempic ads. i tend not to get those anymore although i can't remember if it's bc i disabled
