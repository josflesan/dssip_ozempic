Closer look at Justin beibers questionable history with ‚Äúdebunking‚Äù alleged and unflattering experiences of him. The sideways burrito incident- his team and supporters were quick to hire you tubers to stage like they impersonated him, wiping the original sources online. I remember seeing the pics and reddit posts the day it happened and then a few days later all of those links are wiped and replaced by a similar but slightly off picture of the YouTube in similar clothes. They argue Justin doesn‚Äôt have a pin

"THE LIST" 90s Anonymous Celeb Gossip Site?. Does anyone remember this weird website that was just a giant list of open secrets/blind item stuff about celebrities? I think it still exists but I can't remember how to find it. It was mostly about people who were famous in the 80s/90s. It looked like a Geocities/Angelfire site and was very, very basic. I thought it was called "THE LIST." I'm pretty sure there was some Richard Gere stuff on it. Let me know if this rings a bell!

This shit pisses me off. All the shit some people talk about a harmless drug like pot, schedule <number> drug, then you have all these legal drugs like highly addictive painkillers and other crazy shit who's side effects are 'suicidal thoughts', being pushed by dr's who are supposed to be looking out for your well being. That's pretty messed up if you ask me....

A Far More Likely, Yet Considerably Less Scandalous Cause of Brittany Murphy‚Äôs Death. While many sensationalist hypotheticals surround the death of Brittany Murphy, including but not limited to an elaborate murder plot by her husband Simon Monjack, the fact of the matter is that many of these theories rely too heavily on speculation rather than evidence. Proponents of these hypotheticals cite odd behaviors from Monjack and Murphey and evidence of barium in Murphy's system. Both Murphy and Monjack died from

Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's relationship, or Jelena as they were called, is quite an old topic.

Maybe I'm dense but I didn't really pick up on the backlash the rumor supposedly generated about Kanye's sexuality. The fact that Jeffree Star is a dude was definitely a point of interest but it seemed one reason the rumor picked up so much steam was because it made a lot of sense to folks. Just like Kim, Star is massively famous in his own right and also known for his over the top glamorousness and femininity. Rumors about Kanye's sexuality have circled for years so it was my impression that the public too
