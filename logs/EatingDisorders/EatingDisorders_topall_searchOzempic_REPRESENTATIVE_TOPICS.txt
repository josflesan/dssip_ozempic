I‚Äôm on it too & if anything it‚Äôs actually helped my bulimia + binge eating massively. I obviously feel some people (who are suffering from Anorexia or Orthorexia and are already super thin) are abusing it because they may not need to stop BED or food noise, but for me it‚Äôs helped those a lot. I think people see it as another weight loss drug but I personally feel Tirzepatide in particular has a lot of health benefits.

Like I know if I had the opportunity I would use ozempic I would and have used weight loss drugs. I‚Äôve seen them in the shops and I‚Äôve taken them to the till only to turn back when I realise I‚Äôm too young to buy them. I hate seeing things online about celebrities that are already so skinny and my idea of a perfect body using weight loss drugs. They where designed for people that need to lose weight not for people that have a healthy weight (or even too skinny) If you need to use it great and I hope you

Parents having an eating disorder - pls help. Hello, I am a recovering bulimic, and i have gone through that alone. About a year ago, my father started a diet. From that day, he stopped eating. Like one meal a day. He would go to work and brag about how he hasn‚Äôt eaten all day. I tried to tell him, but he wouldn‚Äôt listen. He goes to the gym for an hour and walks for an hour at night time. He lost so much weight, but nothing will convince him that he needs to stop losing weight. And his shitty dietitian w

I am recovered‚Ä¶ Sister has developed an ED (we are both in our 30s). My older sister who lives <number> min away has developed an ED, according to my parents. From ages <number> - <number> I flirted with bulimia and overexercise and then again from <number> - <number> I had severe bulimia. I‚Äôve been recovered for <number> + years now, and by the grace of God, without inpatient. I am happily married, have since given birth to two young boys, and have a healthier relationship with food. Still working on my body image and not over exercising. I still

Op here is the thing even if you try to help from the heart she will probably think you are trying to make her fat so you can be thinner. I know from myself my older sister never had an eating disorder but when she tried to make me eat i would think that she try to make me gain weight so she can look better even though my sister is not a person like that. Thought itself was so absurd, my sister wouldn't do anything like that but just that little maybe kept lingering in my head. However in your case you had

I‚Äôm so sorry to hear of your struggle‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a ridiculously hard struggle to endure. I‚Äôm a <number> year old female. Shortly after my father died, when I was <number> , I began binge eating. I had a tremendous fear of becoming fat. I was thin at the time but began putting on the pounds. I would binge eat junk food all night long, crying at the same time. To balance the overeating, I would struggle like crazy to fight the weight gain by exercising obsessively. Nonetheless, my clothing started feeling too tight around my

I‚Äôm going to be completely honest. It used to be triggering for me too. I finally with therapy developed a much healthier relationship with food. And then under my doctor‚Äôs care I started mounjaro. I actually found that the mounjaro helped me on my journey to stop binging and purging. I was able to learn helping eating habits to stop binging through therapy, but even after learning healthy eating habits there really is not anything that helps the food noise go away nor did it help my portion control so much

Is this due to my ed? . So I started recovering about <number> months ago (with a relapse in August and a second attempt at recovery in September) and I developed anorexia when I was obese about <number> years ago, along with other lifelong eating disorders. So this is like my first time ever really trying to have a normal relationship with food. I binge here and there, but my extreme hunger went away around July, and my hunger cues came back around last month. I feel like some things are getting better, but the many thi

Omg this would freak me out too. I don‚Äôt have any advice, but I wanted to let you know that your reaction is very valid!
--- Document 3 ---
I agree with this. I think you‚Äôre both valid in how you feel but the issue seems to be things that are hidden and under the surface. It‚Äôs better to just say things out loud and figure out why there was a desire to hide certain things. sending ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

my psych was actually against it but i was feeling quite desperate which is why i agreed to go through with it. gp wrote up a whole treatment plan and everything but its so hard to even get regular appts with him

:\ i‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling like that. i‚Äôve felt like that many times throughout my life, and still struggle with those feelings and thoughts. i don‚Äôt know you personally, but i bet you have so many amazing qualities. i hope you can find the self love you deserve. and remember you aren‚Äôt alone, don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out when things get too hard

I‚Äôve been there. Wished to have an ED, developed one, still hated myself and now had given myself a ton of other problems. Wished to have trauma, had some amnesia lift and and started to remember I actually do have trauma, still hated myself and now had awful memories to deal with. Whatever you are craving, this is not the way to get it. Talk to someone. Get therapy. Find out which of your needs aren‚Äôt met and find ways to meet them that actually help and don‚Äôt cause harm. You deserve to. Wish you all the b

Why should you care that it makes them awkward?! YOU are the one they are making feel awkward! Personally I would fuck with people!! When someone makes a comment like you have said, I would say "Really? Wow I hadn't noticed and walk away". You don't need to care about what anyone thinks. It's your journey!üòò Also if someone stops you and makes a comment say, "sorry can't speak".

This! So many influencers have been caught lying about their WIEIADs. I dunno why they feel the need to flex that they eat way more than they do but still stay so smol üëâüèªüëàüèª. It's deceptive and destructive. Don't believe everything you see. Social media is all smoke, mirrors and lies. They post as if they eat 'whatever they want'... in reality, they don't. Just cause they took a picture of it, doesn't mean they ate it, or all of it. Most of them still engage in ED behaviours masquerading as 'recovery'. You d

I feel it, when I was on my weight lost journey that eventually turned into and ED all my coworkers were praising how much weight I lost etc. It felt really good, but I knew it was because of my ED that I was able to loose most of the weight so quick. None of my coworkers knew and now everyone at work is on a diet. They constantly ask me for tips and I just feel bad giving out any because of how I actually lost the weight.

Triggering ads . I‚Äôve been seeing a ton of ads for injectable weight loss medications recently, does anyone else find these hard to repeatedly see? I wish there was a way to block this kind of content but it‚Äôs just so generally accepted by the public. I think it‚Äôs weighing on my mental health more than I realize.
--- Document 2 ---
Seeing those ads suck. When I see them on tv I try to practice the thought, ‚Äúthat just doesn‚Äôt work for me‚Äù and it‚Äôs something I repeat when people talk about diet culture stuff around me. I cannot control what I hear all the time but I can control how I react and process it. On the internet I can at least report ads and block them and that helps the algorithm figure out I don‚Äôt want to see that content. But in the real world I have to manage my reaction to it. I hope that helps a little.

""targeted"" ads make recovery so much harder. is there any way to report ads that i don't want to see?? i'm trying to recover, and being constantly bombarded with ads for ozempic and other weight loss medications are making this <number> times harder. i mostly get ads for "hers" program, since i looked into it for their anxiety meds a while ago. i use youtube for yoga a lot, and every. single. ad. i get on the videos is an ozempic ad from hers. ive tried reporting the ads, since that used to be a way to mark i
