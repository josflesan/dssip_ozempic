Babs having the exact same vibe as my husband’s aunt is sending me into hysterics. Why do they always mash what should be two separate thoughts into one sentence? It’s like they’re trying to say it quickly before their time is up.

It can for some people, though sometimes it can be alleviated through diet changes, simply sticking with it until the body adjusts to taking it (people with constipation side effects sometimes finds that goes away after a couple months too), or even as much as changing the injection site. Some people who get side effects stop having them simply by switching to injecting to their thigh instead of their stomach, etc. But not everyone gets all these side effects that some people want to hyper focus on. It's

Yes. I was on Victoza a few years ago (a similar drug that required daily injection) and I did lose weight but the side effects were awful and eventually I stopped taking it because of them. And of course I gained all the weight back immediately. It should be done under a doctors care because of those side effects and because you probably need to be on other for life. And as someone who knows two people with lifelong heart issues because of the “miracle drug” phen phen, I am nervous about long term impact
--- Document 3 ---
Every drug has side effects and everyone processes drugs differently based on certain genetic factors. These drugs actually can be a better alternative for some people because being morbidly obese is more dangerous to your health than certain transient side effects. Also some side effects go away after your body adjusts. It sounds like you definitely didn’t tolerate it but some people do and it’s beneficial to them. That’s why the only person whose advice your should take is your doctors. I work in drug r

I think you’ve misunderstood me, nothing in my comment was directed at whether or not people need to, or should, lose weight for their health. And I certainly don’t ‘want’ anyone to lose weight…what they weigh is their business. I was thinking specifically of diabetics who get prescribed ozempic to help regulate their blood sugar. From what I’ve seen, celebs/housewives and the like are taking it purely for aesthetic weight loss, something completely different than losing weight for health reasons. It’s that
--- Document 2 ---
Ozempic is intended for diabetes, but often prescribed off label for weight loss. So they made Wegovy, which is the same active ingredient as Ozempic but at a different dosage and is intended for weight loss. Both are still tough to get. People seeking weight loss who can’t get Wegovy may get off label Ozempic instead, which is less safe and probably depriving a diabetic person of a med they need.
--- Document 3 ---
Yes, this is a major issue. Weight loss is a side effect of Ozempic, not the purpose of it, and if you are taking a medication solely for its side effects, you are going to run into other health issues down the line. There are plenty of other weight loss medications meant specifically for weight loss that people can take. It's irresponsible for her to promote Ozempic as a weight loss medication at all.

They went for a very masculine name for their first daughter and then two very feminine names for the second and third. Maybe they will use a typical boy name for their fourth?

Is this a safe space for me to admit that as someone who never saw the whole movie and only saw this scene, I thought when he told her to say it was ‘carol singers’ that he meant a person named Carol Singers and not carol singers as in people singing Christmas carols
--- Document 3 ---
I'm thinking kind of classic too. My mind goes right to names of old Hollywood stars: For girls, Claudette, Audrey, Rita, Ava, Yvonne, Greta, Marlene, Tallulah, Clara For boys Montgomery, Henry, Cary, Spencer, Laurence, Gene. They could also do the reverse name genders - they have James for a girl, so maybe Leslie for a boy (yes, I know Leslie is also a boys name, but we usually think of it for girls)

VS launched Pink for teens in <number> . Prior to that, Victoria’s Secret was seen as a mature, sexy brand for adult women. Pink was obviously a calculated move to start getting teenagers hooked on their products and I think it was a cash cow for a while. But slowly, the teeny-bopper vibe seeped into the brand. VS loses its allure when you see <number> -year olds with “Victorias Secret” on the back of their sweatpants all over town.
--- Document 2 ---
But that's the thing, I know we people here think everyone & everything can be sexy but does the people in this world at masses have same line of thinking? Are people in this world likely to associate true plus size (not the kind VS think is plus size) and LGBTQ models as sexy & glamorous? Don't you think the very idea their "sexy" was based on was at odd with what we as progressives think of "sexy" as? I feel it's better they just scrapped it. While in ideal world we would want redefining of word "sexy"
--- Document 3 ---
I think it was good thing they scrapped whole Angel concept. It was very homophobic & fatphobic at its core. People saying them adding plus size models and models belonging to LGBTQ community would have solved the problem are overlooking the fact that the very idea of VS Angels wouldn't have allowed it. The idea from very begining was this glamorous version of high fashion but from the POV of straight men with dash of eurocentrism. I don't think people would have been accepting of bringing progressive

He’s always been this way, just in a more subtle way. His whole channel and career is built around feuding. Feuding with DramaAlert, with Kavanaugh, with Trisha, with Hasan, with anyone that takes his bait. He had a slightly decent channel but then he noticed his viewed skyrocketed when he was feuding with someone and making all the back and forth videos. Just look at what happened with Trisha. He made a bunch of videos insulting her and calling her mentally unstable, his channel exploded so he made an en

I think that's missing the actual point of what was wrong with the whole situation. Hila was more a symptom of the greater problem: Ethan Klein cares more about Israel's image that the genocide they're committing. The conversation is that Hasan and other Muslim streamers are calling out Israel for their obvious war crimes, and Ethan keeps conflating it with antisemitism (which is antisemetic itself), calling most people who side with Palestinians, terrorist supporters, and overall being a Zionist shill.
--- Document 3 ---
tl;dr Ethan’s wife (Hila) was a former IDF soldier who admitted she tagged along to raid people’s homes. Said it was more fun over paperwork. Basically admitted (in my opinion) she had fun terrorizing civilians. This came to bite her in the ass when the Gaza/Israel war happened. People were rightfully horrified by her comments and “cancelled” her. Ethan didn’t take this lightly. Also Ethan now has a hate boner for Hasan since (iirc) he called out Hila for that shit.

Oh, I'm glad I'm not the only one to think it's baaad. I saw that look on some "good" list and just went "WHAT" out loud. I get the intention but nothing really works here. Especially the hair. Edit. Someone (not on reddit) legit said I'm just jealous of her, oh my gooood. Are we in kindergarten?
--- Document 2 ---
As soon as I saw that photo I knew there were going to be twenty comments about how it washes her out lol. The color matches her skin tone so closely that it has to be intentional. I think it looks really pretty. I dislike the tea length and her hair doesn’t make sense with the dress though.

Glad to see Celine looking healthy but the coat look is confusing for an event like this, especially when she was presenting. Looks like she had a gown in beneath. The idea of presenting in a coat totally works but this coat (which probs cost more than my monthly salary) doesn’t feel special enough for the occasion. There are a couple other photos of her where she’s clutching her coat shut so I wonder if there was a wardrobe malfunction or something?

The extreme misogyny of the <number> ’s and early <number> ’s isn’t discussed enough in my opinion. At the time I remember just thinking it was par for the course, but looking back I’m generally shocked at some of the things the media and society got away with. Being anything less than a size <number> was obscene and the way people bombarded young woman on tv about their weight was constant. The fashion trends were geared toward the male gaze (whale tails, super low-rise jeans, low cut baby doll tops). Not that I think men
--- Document 2 ---
And for women, or those who are women presenting, the only two options that society seems to place on us are “fat” and “skinny”. But men go through so many “stages” before they’re fat. Men get so much more grace when they’re overweight, but women’s bodies are constantly under scrutiny. So many of us have ingrained it too, even with the body positivity and body neutrality movements. It makes me so sad to be in the women’s bathroom and constantly hear women of all ages criticizing their appearance so casually
--- Document 3 ---
As someone who has yo-yoed in weight, it took me years to realize size is just a number. I shouldn't fixate on being a certain size even though society tells women to all the time. My Instagram gets inundated with these reels of women wearing the same outfit in different sizes. Sometimes, I can't tell the difference and I think both women look amazing. Those videos made me realize that size is just a number and I should find clothes that fit and flatter my body.

read the article, and she's talking about how since Oprah owns a stake in weight watchers, and they just started on the weight loss drug train, that might be an explanation for why Oprah switched from "taking drugs would be the easy way out" to "I'm on ozempic, I need it". still don't love it coming from Jillian michaels but it is a fair point
--- Document 2 ---
read article and she is talking about how Oprah has a stake in weight watchers, which just expanded their business to include WL drugs. so Oprah switching from saying "taking drugs is the easy way out" to "yeah I take ozempic" probably does have to do with the financial benefits. still stand by the fact that Jillian should not talk about fat ppl before doing some serious reparations for what she has done.

My best friend drops weight extremely fast after giving birth - breastfeeding just made it all fall off her within a couple weeks. Also I think people forget how tall Blake is, she's around <number> - <number> . You definitely carry weight differently depending on your height, and a 5kg or even 10kg gain isn't as noticeable as it would be on a woman who is <number> or <number>

This just reminded me of a convo I overheard between two <number> + year old women in the gym locker room the other day. Woman <number> : “I’ve lost <number> pounds this month” Woman <number> : “did you? Did you lose <number> pounds?” Woman <number> : “well, I gained <number> pounds last month but I lost <number> this month” Woman <number> : “you told me you gained <number> pounds last month. If you gained <number> and lost <number> , you’ve only lost <number> pound.” Insert me shooting daggers with my eyes at woman <number> , what a bitch.

I would too if I were famous and not just because the media and fans are ruthless when it comes to the appearance of a celebrity. A huge part of their job is “looking the part”, where non celebrities focus their energy into advancing their career by taking extra courses, joining meetings and keeping their knowledge up-to-date, actors focus their energy into working out, learning their lines and table reads. It makes sense!

Hey, I did a lot of work for them and they’re not. During COVID, the US government actually contracted with them to help provide formula and diapers to low-income families. Essentially, because Baby2Baby’s connections and contracts with companies were so good, they beat the prices the government received for diapers and formula. Literally, the diapers that they give out for free are of incredible quality and are manufactured at v low costs. They are definitely the nonprofit that every celeb wants to be a
