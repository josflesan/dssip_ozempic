yeah, very similar experience here, with regards to cravings and binge eating Taking the ER foruma helped a lot. Also, taking OTC drugs with each dose to mitigate the side effects. Talk to your doctor - Pepto Bismol (nausea, diarrhea) - Imodium (diarrhea) - Dimenhydrinate and/or Meclizine (nausea) {may cause drowsiness} The GI side effects have to do with your stomachs normal flora, and how it adjusts to an increase of unabsorbed sugar.

How would you respond?. I was always skinny but gained weight after my son. Within the last year and a half, I lost 50lbs just from diet and exercise ( <number> - <number> I’m <number> ’ <number> ”) I’m happy with how I feel and much happier with how I look. However, every day and usually <number> or <number> times a day at work, several women that I work with make rude comments to me. “You look like you’re wasting away.” “You’re too skinny.” “Don’t lose anymore weight.” “That scrub top looks like a dress on you (dirty look)” Yet, there’s other p

Honestly, why would you do it another way? If you announce and constantly talk about weight loss, first off people will be annoyed with you. Secondly, if you’re NOT successful then people know you tried and failed. Just do. Don’t say.

You need to check into the PCOS symptoms by getting a referral to an endocrinologist. PCOS and adrenal tumors have similar symptoms, and both are treated by endocrinologists. If you have high insulin and/or insulin resistance, they will most likely prescribe Metformim, which can really help with weightloss. Personally, when I went on Metformin for PCOS, I dropped about <number> lbs really quick. After that, diet and exercise finally worked.

If no one said it yet, get a referral to an endocrinologist. There's a variety of reasons your thyroid can be off. It can take awhile to get thyroid levels right, so just wanted to warn you/prepare you that it is a long process sometimes. I have Graves disease and had to get my thyroid radiated/dead, so medically I'm <percent> hypothyroid now. Took about a year to get the thyroid hormone dosage correct.

These symptoms can be indicative of undiagnosed Celiac disease. Elevated cholesterol and anemia can be directly caused by Celiac disease. If I were a doctor, these would trigger me to instantly order a blood screening for Celiac. Also, symptoms that are often associated with Thyroid issues can also be Celiac. I had fatigue, weight issues, joint pain… all my doctors tested for Thyroid issues like their lives depended on it, but never even considered Celiac. My thyroid numbers were always “good enough”.

Everyone is talking about calories in and out and weighing food, and those are good, but it doesn’t help with cravings, bingeing, emotional eating, etc. I would recommend using a DBT or CBT workbook for binge eating or something similar. There’s a CBT Diet Book that has a day by day plan for six weeks to change how you view food and eating called the Beck Diet Solution. There’s also a DBT book for Binge Eating called the DBT Solution for Emotional Eating by Debra Slater. CICO, exercise, etc is all necessary

TW: ED It took me several years to stop binge eating. I used to be bulimic in high school and that eating disorder turned into a binge eating disorder in college and I gained a ton of weight. I got up to my heaviest weight in <number> at <number> kg and had tried to lose weight several times, but couldn't stop binging. I ended up doing keto from <number> - <number> and that helped a bit because I felt really satiated from the amount of fat and protein I was eating.

I agree; the book Brain Over Binge is extremely powerful and eye opening to how binges become habit forming. I’ve read the book multiple times to remind myself that I can’t binge without the urge to binge. So if I don’t give in to the urge binge then I can’t binge. Long story short the book explains very matter of fact that binges are simply a very strong habit we have created. If you don’t get the book check out the podcast Brain Over Binge.

I don't normally have "food noise" but I absolutely **have** had it in the past. Anytime I've dieted / restricted food I've had intense food noise; my brain was constantly trying to get me to eat. I know the difference between regular hunger and food noise. They are totally different.
--- Document 2 ---
Food noise is the whole reason I'm overweight. I never knew it was a thing though until recently when I heard people talking about those new medications. I'd just always assumed I had terrible self control compared to other people. If it wasn't for food noise, I could easily lose weight and stick to my goal weight at the end of it. I do intermittent fasting and I can happily go all day without food if I want to if the food noise doesn't interfere. It's just a constant daily battle against the food noise to

Yeah okay so i don't think any of what you experience is normal, that sounds like more than one medical issues I just measure out a portion and eat. Even if i get hungry later and run out of calories it's not like i'm constantly hungry, it goes away pretty soon. Not like feeling hungry would hurt, the bloating can be annoying. I could go for <number> hours before it starts to bother and the hunger comes back But also there is a serious lag between the two so pretty sure you are not supposed to eat to feel ful

I could eat a <number> calorie meal and still be hungry. So I would eat <number> more calories, and my stomach would still be growling. So I would eat another <number> calories and I would still be hungry. Not craving, not wanting sweets, not unsatisfied, but HUNGRY with an empty feeling and needing more food. I would eat until I had trouble breathing and not feel full, but I had to literally stop eating, because my body couldn't physically hold any more food. It wasn't junk, it wasn't takeout, it was food I was cook

<number> pounds in five months is ... doable. It will take dedication, and will get harder as you get closer to your goal weight. <number> pounds a month is <number> pounds a week, which is on the high side for the recommended healthy speed of weight loss ( <number> to <number> pounds a week), but is achievable. Most of weight loss is really in your diet. Eat smaller portions, is the bottom line. Choose healthy options. Working out will help with your mental health, plus will help your resolve: when you realize you've worked out for an hou

It is entirely dependent on how much weight you have to lose. Do you need to lose over <number> lbs? Then, with proper diet and exercise, you could lose a significant amount of weight over <number> months. But honestly, does the amount really matter? Time still exists beyond <number> months from now. Would you stop trying to reach your goal if <number> months passed and you still had <number> more lbs to go? And regardless of how much you lost, wouldn't that still be positive forward progress? It shouldn't be all or nothing, nor shoul

I've lost <number> pounds in about <number> months. Granted I started about <number> pounds higher than you. It is doable. <number> pounds at <number> pounds a month is very achievable. Just be kind to yourself if you celebrate holidays this time of year. Bank those in and understand how you will tackle. All I did was use My Fitness pal and calculated my daily calorie goal. I started going to the gym a few days a week (weights only) ans started adding habits. Now I walk minimum of 10k steps a day, hit the gym <number> - <number> days a week, and added

There is still a lot of potential with apple. Keep at it. Lots of women gymnasts and track and field althetes are apple shaped. They are just also extremely fit and muscular. Many of them do dance and choreography and look extremely feminine. Try wrap dresses with solid, bold/neutral colors or large fun prints. Small flower prints in dull colors actually highlight weight, in my opinion. Shape wear can also help significantly but be sure to get the right size, if it's too tight it won't help. Platform/wedge

I am <number> ’ <number> and apple shaped 🤣 it’s like a bowling ball tottering on a pair of sticks LMAO. But I love being an apple! I’m old… but in the 00s it was desirable to have a flat nonexistent butt. A “big” butt was undesirable. Which goes to show how silly beauty standards are. At some point we have to embrace what we have and flaunt it whether or not it’s “in”. Yes, every ounce of fat lives in my midsection and clothes fit very strangely, but on the plus side, big boobs and slim legs and arms! Also, I will sa

Agreed. I feel like keeping your old fat clothes can manifest into gaining the weight back. I gained some weight back and working now on getting back to my lower weight. I do not have any of my fat clothes and glad I got rid of them as I could see myself going through those bags of clothes right now for clothes to wear. That would have been depressing to wear ANY of those clothes again.

are you eating high protein? <number> -30g of high quality (animal products) protein <number> or <number> times a day? i start the day out with some fish or chicken. it really helps with satiety. idk the studies but there is evidence. i still end up a tiny bit hungry because i am eating under maintenance but it is bearable. i also like the micronutrient smoothiss by rhonda patrick because they have a ton of nutrients for about <number> calories and are very satisfying (they include protein powder, tomatoes, carrots and flax). but if

Make the most of your <number> calories and eat lean meats, vegetables and complex carbohydrates. Try to aim for <number> meals a day or <number> meals and a snack. Time your meals so you eat before the feeling of hunger occurs, the science behind this method is keeping ghrelin levels low. Ghrelin is a hormone that is released when your stomach is empty and sugar makes it worse.Eat Whole Foods try to stay away from processed foods including protein shakes. 23g of protein from chicken breast is better than 23g of protein pow

By the time summer comes you should be at the weight you wanna be at . Also try eating less junk and more protein, veges, fruits during the eating window of ur intermittent fasting. Another secret is to drink green tea if u can handle it (without sugar) as this speeds up metabolism and burns fat esp alongside the intermittent fasting. Drink it in the morning and alsona cup in t
