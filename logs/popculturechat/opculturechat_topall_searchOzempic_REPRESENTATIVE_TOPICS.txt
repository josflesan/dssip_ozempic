Yeah my friend into wrestling said the same but I thought you know years removed he would use us normie weight lol. Yeah I understood that but he still looks more trim than he did pre knock at the cabin so I was wondering what role that’s for.

Obviously, could be Ozempic, but I saw Mick Foley (wrestler) do stand up years ago and he went to high school with Kevin James. He said that Kevin James was an amazing athlete and an all-state wrestler in his heyday, so this could also be a guy who's got the time and money to eat a healthy diet and work out however he wants losing weight, especially since he's getting older. For a guy who's already into fitness or working out, the weight can really shed off quickly if you don't have to worry about your di

>Yeah my friend into wrestling said the same but I thought you know years removed he would use us normie weight lol. The thing with wrestling is that your character is a part of you and always will. It used to be that retired wrestlers would keep up their character whenever they were in public regardless of how long it has been. Obviously that isn't possible in this era but most wrestlers try to keep some elements of that mystique. He looks more trim because when you lose a lot of weight fast you will pret

I love the neckline, it looks so elegant! But the rest of the dress seems a bit stiff in a way, I feel like it would look super cute in a fabric with a bit of stretch to it. What do you think of the styling? I love the jewelry choices. I also love the purse,, but it feels like the proportions are a bit off with this particular dress, especially for evening. I think a smaller clutch would have been a better fit. But if anyone knows I NEEED the deets on the bag! It's so chic and would be a perfect fit for

Bella eve only admitted the nose job but she changed her face a lot to cater that model look and face that works very well for her but is it healthy? This combined with her (extreme) lost of weight (sorry not body shaming but it’s worrying). Idk I’m concerned about the road Bella is taking. It works again cause she fits what her industry wants but she look ill most of the time, i don’t see the spark or joy i used to see in her few years back. I know she also struggles with anxiety but i hope she’s taking

I think it's combination of the lighting and make-up. I have a similar face shape (long and high cheek bones). After i turner <number> if the lightting comes from above i get that same effect...the cheeks almost look seperate from the face.. And she has quite a bit of light blush wich kind of high lights the cheeks. I think most celebs who are suspected of buccal havent had it, they are just over <number> , have high cheek bones and low body fat. edit spelling

I’m totally talking out of my ass here LMAO but sometimes I feel like her styling is made to make her look more like her sisters. Like they’re *trying* to make her face look thinner and longer, but it ends up making her look odd and sunken-in bc her face is honestly not that gaunt. I just can’t figure out why else some of her makeup looks try to thin out her face and excessively contour her cheeks like this lol. It fascinates me honestly bc I think she’s so gorgeous, but she looks like a whooole different

What is your least fave celebrity/influencer street style trend right now?? (For me, it's a tie between metallic boots and those deranged Valentino platform heels) :(.
--- Document 2 ---
not necessarily a street style trend, but i don't like the bleached eyebrows or the buccal fat removal. as far as street style goes, i hate hate HATE that sheer tights, sweater and no pants trend.... it's just stupid.
--- Document 3 ---
Oversized wide leg pants that end above the ankle. Especially if they aren't hemmed but every pair I've ever seen on every body is atrocious. Honestly a lot of the bulky and ill fitting trendy clothes look awful to me on anyone but it's definitely something that is geared towards slender bodies. I think other 2010s trends have been more flattering on bigger bodies like mine. Also hate buccal fat removal and bleached brows and am Concerned about "thinspiration" type stuff coming back for the sake of teenag

It’s really not up to the majority of them. Producers, casting agents, marketing departments, etc decide these things and they pick people who already look like what they want or are willing to alter themselves. If you opt out of that, you just drastically reduce your job opportunities and someone else gets the role. For social media “influencers”, the users, marketing companies, and the algorithm choose who succeeds and fails.

That just is how gossip is in general. You gotta remember, there’s like <number> users subscribed to this sub — so that means the turnover rate of different commenters and different opinions are high. Since it’s gossip, most people tend to snark (cause gossip has rarely been a petty thing) so… Not a big surprise there. Like example. On the other sub — they permaban me for mentioning that Selena Gomez (there is a literal video) of her stumbling on the carpet. Pretty sure just one of the mods had it out for m

Sometimes I wonder if we will ever get back to a point where small misteps and clearly unintended meaning that cause no real harm can just be laughed at and moved on. The way such small things get blown up into news stories that require multiple statements to be put out is just wild. It was an awkward comment on social media that most people should just chuckle at and move on. It does not require this level of discourse.

plastic surgery is always going to be a weird point of contention when it comes to talking about beauty standards- like mostly i'm for it, stop shaming women for getting procedures done when people turn round and shame women for not having the perfect body/face naturally. but i also do worry about how much the industry is regulated, considering many people do suffer from body dysmorphia and there doesn't seem to be many systems in place for when plastic surgery becomes detrimental to your wellbeing/health.

Jess and I are close in age. I recently lost <number> lbs and went from an obese weight to a healthy one. I can tell you that even though I weight the same as I did when I was young, my face looks WAY thinner than it did way back then. The baby fat is gone and people who knew me then think I look SO thin. I have to tell I'm the same weight, it just looks different now.
