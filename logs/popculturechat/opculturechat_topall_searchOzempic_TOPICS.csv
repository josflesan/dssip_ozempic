Yea, grown ass adults know what’s going on. But they don’t, and when they hear celebs say they lost 60lbs in <number> weeks by “diet and exercise” they believe it. And agreed, no one should be asked about their body. *However*, we live in a world with fitness magazines and celebrities doing interviews about what they eat in a day. So it just isn’t a realistic thing. Of course, they can and frankly should keep that to themselves. But the issue is, they don', 'Occasionally these fat dudes in Hollywood get tired of being the chubby funny guy so they use their money for personal trainers and weight loss drugs.

Personally, I find it much more pleasing when some skinny actors get complacent and put on like <number> pounds out of the blue', ""No, they really haven't. Fat actors and actresses especially tended to stay fat, both because it's really hard to lose weight and also because being fat was often a big part of their on screen identity. John Goodman and Drew Carey both underwent gastric bypass surgery. I think Jonah Hill is about the only actor who lost weight the hard way. Even Hurley from Lost and Chrissy Metz from This is Us are now starting to lose weight, thanks to Ozempic.""]"

For one, hasn’t she posted old clips while previously pregnant to throw people off? And for two, she could be pregnant and just not showing.
